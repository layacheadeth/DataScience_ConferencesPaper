0,Planetwise Flannel Wipes,"These flannel wipes are OK, but in my opinion not worth keeping.  I also ordered someImse Vimse Cloth Wipes-Ocean Blue-12 countwhich are larger, had a nicer, softer texture and just seemed higher quality.  I use cloth wipes for hands and faces and have been usingThirsties 6 Pack Fab Wipes, Boyfor about 8 months now and need to replace them because they are starting to get rough and have had stink issues for a while that stripping no longer handles.",0
1,Planetwise Wipe Pouch,it came early and was not disappointed. i love planet wise bags and now my wipe holder. it keps my osocozy wipes moist and does not leak. highly recommend it.,1
2,Annas Dream Full Quilt with 2 Shams,Very soft and comfortable and warmer than it looks...fit the full size bed perfectly...would recommend to anyone looking for this type of quilt,2
3,Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book,"This is a product well worth the purchase.  I have not found anything else like this, and it is a positive, ingenious approach to losing the binky.  What I love most about this product is how much ownership my daughter has in getting rid of the binky.  She is so proud of herself, and loves her little fairy.  I love the artwork, the chart in the back, and the clever approach of this tool.",3
4,Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book,"All of my kids have cried non-stop when I tried to ween them off their pacifier, until I found Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet.  It is an easy way to work with your kids to allow them to understand where their pacifier is going and help them part from it.This is a must buy book, and a great gift for expecting parents!!  You will save them soo many headaches.Thanks for this book!  You all rock!!",4
5,Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book,"When the Binky Fairy came to our house, we didn't have any special gift and book to help explain to her about how important it is to stop using a pacifier. This book does a great job to help prepare your child for the loss of their favorite item. The doll is adorable and we made lots of cute movies with the Binky Fairy telling our daughter about what happens when the Binky Fairy comes. I would highly recommend this product for any parent trying to break the pacifier or thumb sucking habit.",5
6,A Tale of Baby's Days with Peter Rabbit,"Lovely book, it's bound tightly so you may not be able to add alot of photos/cards aside from the designated spaces in the book. Shop around before you purchase, as it is currently listed at Barnes & Noble for 29.95!",6
7,"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","Perfect for new parents. We were able to keep track of baby's feeding, sleep and diaper change schedule for the first two and a half months of her life. Made life easier when the doctor would ask questions about habits because we had it all right there!",7
8,"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","A friend of mine pinned this product on Pinterest so I decided to give it a whirl! It is fantastic! If you are a new parent, this will help you keep track of feedings, diaper changes and the like!",8
9,"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log",This has been an easy way for my nanny to record all the key events that happen with my baby when I'm not at home.  Would highly recommend it to someone who wants to stay informed of what your baby is up to while you're not home.The only reason this isn't a 5 is because I think there could have been some more standarad pre-printed options.I plan on ordering another one when we run out of pages in this journal.,9
10,"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I love this journal and our nanny uses it everyday to track on our daughter's sleep, eating and other activities. The layout and design make it very easy to fill in quickly with a comments column to add in details (i.e. we ask the nanny to specify what food she had for lunch, amount of milk she took, specifics of play time--tummy time, walk to park, etc.) I love knowing the details of my baby's day, and I also use it to track weekly on overall schedule patterns and changes (i.e. baby's nap time has moved naturally as she gets older).My only complaint is that there is no real space to communicate back to the nanny, as I sometimes want to reply to the nanny's comments and/or leave her notes about the previous night (i.e. Baby didn't sleep well or baby has rash, etc) or other instructions (Please use sun screen on the baby - it's hot out today) that I often forget to tell her in the rush of the morning. I just stick in post-its now for my notes. All in all, I highly recommend this baby tracker.",10
11,"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","This book is perfect!  I'm a first time new mom, and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, sleep.  Definitely would recommend this for new moms.  Plus it's small enough that I throw in the diaper back for doctor visits.",11
12,"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I originally just gave the nanny a pad of paper to write down this information for my little one. She would take him to the park and leave the pad behind - I was getting incomplete/inaccurate information when she wohld get home at the end of the day and try to remember naps/feedings/diaper changes. I wanted something she could take with her and also a way to better control how she reported information. This was the perfect solution! Now I'm getting all the information I wanted. There is a very helpful example of how to fill it out. It also has a pouch for additional documents and a section up front for emergency contact info. Each page goes from 7 - 6. This works for me because the nanny starts at 7am and ends before 6pm. I use an app on my phone for tracking when I'm with the baby. I transfer the info from this notebook to my phone. My only complaint: the space is pretty small - they provide useful shorthand, but it's a little difficult to fit some of the info in the space provided. Also, some of the other reviews complain about the 7 - 6 time format. This isn't a real problem for me, but I suppose if you wanted to track an entire day, you would have to use two pages - not too big of a deal. 7am - 6pm is pretty much perfect for daycare/nanny/caregiver situation.",12
13,"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I thought keeping a simple handwritten journal would be nice.  But I haven't used this thing at all, and here's why:1.) When you're breastfeeding, it's often nice to have your phone close by so that you can keep yourself entertained.  If you are able to grab *both* your phone and this notebook - and a pen - consistently - and at 3 in the morning - you are more skilled than me.  (I don't nurse in the same place every time.)2.) You're also often so sleep deprived that - at least for me - I'd forget to look at what time we started on a side, or what side we started on.  I'm not perfect with the app I have either, but at least I just have to mindlessly hit a button.3.) I really like the app I have (Baby Connect).  It gives me better data.  For example, it can tell me how long on average feedings have been taking (helpful as we start to think about sleep training).  It can tell me that I nursed him 177 times last month (granted that serves no useful purpose other than a feeling of perverse satisfaction).",13
14,Nature's Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar,"Space for monthly photos, info and a lot of useful stickers come with it. It is exactly what I wanted!!",14
15,Nature's Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar,"I bought this calender for myself for my second son. It is very colorful and has room on each page to write height, weight, and what baby likes to do. There is also room on each page for a photo to be placed. The calender date boxes have room for a sticker and some fine writing. My only complaint is that it does not have as many stickers as I would like, but I just put asterisks before whatever special event happened that day. I bought one for a friend as she found it very useful as well.",15
16,Nature's Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar,"I love this little calender, you can keep track of all of baby's firsts. I like the illustrations, and the stickers too.",16
17,Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,This was the only calender I could find for the second year. I did one for the first and wanted to continue cause there are so many things to note still after they turn 1. This one was better than the first year one I got him.,17
18,Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,I completed a calendar for my son's first year and really enjoyed tracking all of his milestones and special moments - so much so that I wanted to continue in the second year since he's still doing amazing and fun things every day.  I really like the simple layout of the calendar and while it might not have all the questions and milestone stickers you want - at least it's something to keep recording all those special moments!,18
19,Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,We wanted to get something to keep track of our child's milestones and this is a cute option. There aren't many other choices out there and this does exactly what we wanted.,19
20,Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"I had a hard time finding a second year calendar, this is the only one I came across and it is great!  Large enough to write in the squares and has a spot to put that month's picture in as well as some memories. The first two years they change so much I like to jot everything down so I can keep track of all the big milestones...and little ones!  I find it is easier to do this on a calendar vs a baby book.  This way you can fill out the baby book later and have a great reference to do so!",20
21,Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"I only purchased a second-year calendar for my son because I had one for my daughter. I was really disappointed with the lack of selection available for second-year calendars in general, so I just got this one because it was one of the only ones. It's an okay calendar. The finish on the pages is glossy which makes it hard to write on with certain pens. The stickers aren't very cute and the pages are pretty old-fashioned looking. Hopefully they will come out with some other calendars for future purchasers.",21
22,Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,I LOVE this calendar for recording events of my son's second year of life.  There are plenty of 1st year baby calendars out there and I loved reocording events of his first year and didn't want to just stop now that he is one.  Nature's lullabies second year calendar is perfect for continuing on with daily record keeping.  The stickers are wonderful and helped me think of milestones to record that I might not have thought of on my own.  I highly recommend this calendar!  Plus it's super cute and brat for either gender.,22
23,Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"Calendar is exactly as described, but I find the look of it to be very cheap.  There are lots of nice stickers to use.  I was just disappointed it looks so cheap.",23
24,Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"Wife loves this calender. Comes with a lot of stickers and options to mark the firsts. Includes spaces for milestone photos as well. Sticker borders for photos, etc, it is just a very easy to use scrap booking option. Especially for new moms who dont have enough time to actually sit down, and haul out a ton of scrapbook supplies",24
25,Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,My daughter had her 1st baby over a year ago. She did receive and fill up a First Year Calendar. When her son was nearing his first birthday she was looking for a Second Year Calendar to record his milestones. Thanks to Amazon I was able to get this for her and she LOVES it. Tender sweet art work - helpful stickers - unique pages to fill. A nice keepsake. A wonderful gift for a one-year old!,25
26,Baby's First Journal - Green,"Extremely useful! As a new mom, tired and inexpedient, not remembering how long ago baby ate, this definitely helped me through the first two months.",26
27,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",My son loves peek a boo at this age of 9 months so I thought this book would be perfect! This book doesn't engage him enough though it seems.  He does however like the cover the most if I make pretend blow-kisses and peekaboo gestures with the hands and show him. He also likes when I fan the hair towards his face.Maybe when he's older he will flip the flaps but right now he just likes the mirror at the end and the front cover. If I flip the book through he just takes the book and shakes it around.,27
28,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","One of baby's first and favorite books, and it is washable! I gave 1 less star than perfect because I'd like to see some diversity in the people - not just your typical white family ;)",28
29,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",I like how the book has a hook to attach it to your stroller or car seat - it wont get lost.  Great way to go over family members.,29
30,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",Beautiful little book.  A great little short story saying I Love You....Keeps the attention of the baby and then the baby can actually turn the pages and hold on to it when you are finished interacting with it.,30
31,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",This book is so worth the money. It says 9+ months on the box but I can't wait for my baby to be born to try to use it before. It's so cute and very interactive! There are flaps to open on every page.,31
32,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","we just got this book for our one-year-old and she loves it.  It's so nice that she can't bite chunks out of it like she can a board book or rip it like a paper one.  She can chew on it, pull on it, and carry it all over the house!  She loves the little flaps that open and is learning simple words like ""daddy,"" ""mommy,"" ""puppy,"" etc.  We love it.",32
33,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",The book is colorful and is perfect for 6months and older. The only thing I didn't like was the strong smell of the dyes and/or material. I dunked the pages in detergent. Then let the book dry overnight.,33
34,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","The book is cute, and we are huge fans of Lamaze products, however, this one leaves out some family members (no little brother) and can possibly cause hurt feelings. That said, our baby loves to play with the hands, hair and flaps!",34
35,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",What a great book for babies!  I'd been looking for books which couldn't be damaged by my 10-month old's drool...so cloth or plastic books were my options.  This book adds another level to your usual cloth book--a fun flap or moving part on every page.  This interactive book is perfect for my baby!,35
36,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","My son loved this book as an infant.  It was perfect because he would chew on his board books and destroy them, but this one we didn't have that issue.  I love the Lamaze series, they are a lot of fun not only for the child but for the parent.I liked that this book was not only teaching my son about Peek a Boo, but we used it to learn names for family members like grandparents, sister, cat, dog etc.  And of course with it being a lift the flap book, that was additional fun for my son as well.  He's nearly two now and he doesn't look at it as much, but he still does enjoy reading it and playing with it now and again.  I'd say out of all the Lamaze books, this one and Discovery Farm are his favorites.",36
37,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","Our baby loves this book & has loved it for a while now ... He enjoys when I read it to him, and enjoys playing with it on his own.",37
38,SoftPlay Twinkle Twinkle Elmo A Bedtime Book,,38
39,SoftPlay Twinkle Twinkle Elmo A Bedtime Book,My son likes brushing elmo's teeth. Almost too nice of a book to let the kids play with haha :),39
40,SoftPlay Twinkle Twinkle Elmo A Bedtime Book,This was a birthday present for my 2 year old grandchildren.  They love this book and will sit and go through it page by page themselves .  The pictures are imaginative and appeal to young children.  Would buy it again!,40
41,"SoftPlay Giggle Jiggle Funbook, Happy Bear","This bear is absolutely adorable and I would give it a 5 star rating if it actually giggled or growled like it was suppose to!  I just got it in the mail the other day and was super excited when I saw how cute it was!  If it's something as simple as a dead battery I could handle it BUT I can't even find a place where the batteries would to!  Such a disappointment....it's going back and I have no gift to take down to my new Granddaughter, Kenzie, now!",41
42,SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,"My baby absolutely loves Elmo and so this book seemed perfect for her.  I'm happy to say I was right:  this book is nice and soft and beautifully illustrated so my little one takes it everywhere and ""reads"" it all of the time. While Elmo is the main character of because he hides on each page, other Sesame Street characters are also featured which is fun, too. Another great, interactive, Elmo centric book that I would recommend for the Sesame Street/Elmo lovers is ""Twinkle, Twinkle Elmo"" (which is also available on Amazon for a great price).",42
43,SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,"I bought two for recent baby showers!  The book is soft and interactive, great for any baby, and the bright colors are beautiful.  Lastly, who doesn't love Elmo!",43
44,SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,"We wanted to get another book like the Big Birds Friends softplay book, and we only found the two Elmo books. This one is fun, but the Big Bird book has more variety and is more creative.",44
45,SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,This is a cute little peek-a-boo story book.  It's soft.  It's safe.  And it is easy for baby to handle.,45
46,SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,"My 3 month old son loves this book. We read it over and over and he smiles and laughs every time we find Elmo and say &#34;peekaboo Elmo!&#34;  We have a few different soft books and this is the most colorful and fun to read. And baby adores it, so 5 stars for sure.",46
47,SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,Very cute interactive book! My son loves this book! The bright colorful illustrations make this great for babies & toddlers.,47
48,"SoftPlay 4 Pack Block Book, Sweet Sesame","Bought for granddauchildren and they play with them all the time.  Love reading to them.  Soft, so if they fall on them, they are safe. When they use the Elmo book, the kiss Elmo.  Got when they were 9 mos, now they are two and we are still having fun with them.  They love to see how high they can stack the blocks before it falls over.  I buy as a baby present.",48
49,"SoftPlay 4 Pack Block Book, Sweet Sesame","I have teething babies and these were great for entertaining the, and letting them chew and droll all over the, without worrying about ruining them. They were great for setting them off to their side to encourage rolling over and crawling. Great Christmas gift for the younger baby and didn't break the bank.",49
50,"SoftPlay Cloth Book, Love",This book is boring. Nothing to stimulate my granddaughter. It is a waste of money. I would not recommend it,50
51,SoftPlay Baby's First Cloth Books Gift Set,"It is so hard to find cloth books with ACTUAL images on them! So many have unrealistic portrayals of what animals/objects look like, but this one is fantastic. EXACTLY what we were looking for!!When we teach our 1 year old what a ""lion"" is, we want to show him a REAL lion... not a drawing that looks nothing like a real lion.",51
52,"SoftPlay Cloth Book, Hugs","for the young child, very cute...so happy they can &#34; read&#34; something there is little or no chance of them destroying..many happy reading memories",52
53,SoftPlay Baby Animals of the World Soft Cloth Book,"not bad but not as interesting to my 1-year old as I thought. Mot interactive [texture, etc] but cute anyway",53
54,Baby's First Year Undated Wall Calendar with Stickers to Mark &quot;Firsts&quot; - Pink,A friend bought me this calendar when our daughter was born.  Love it!  It's so fun and will be a great momento.,54
55,Baby's First Year Undated Wall Calendar with Stickers to Mark &quot;Firsts&quot; - Pink,"Quick and Easy to keep up with all the first milestones of a little one, especially for a busy, first-time Mom.",55
56,Baby's First Year Undated Wall Calendar with Stickers to Mark &quot;Firsts&quot; - Pink,I searched high and low for a first year calendar and settled on this one based on the reviews.  I am so happy that I did.  Perfect for jotting down quick memories throughout the month and remembering dates of baby's &#34;firsts&#34;.  Will be fun to look back on.  Also has spots for personalization and pictures.,56
57,Baby's First Year Undated Wall Calendar with Stickers to Mark &quot;Firsts&quot; - Pink,This is a very good gift for a new mother.  You would want to give it to the parents as soon as baby is born so that they can start from the very beginning to chart the &#34;firsts&#34;.  I had one of these calendars for each of my five children.  They enjoy looking up their &#34;firsts&#34; especially as they are now parents themselves.,57
58,Our Baby Girl Memory Book,,58
59,Our Baby Girl Memory Book,Absolutely love it and all of the Scripture in it.  I purchased the Baby Boy version for my grandson when he was born and my daughter-in-law was thrilled to receive the same book again.,59
60,Our Baby Girl Memory Book,Bought as a gift for my daughter in law. She loved it. Simple but a place to put important memories down. I loved the verses at bottom of pages.,60
61,Our Baby Girl Memory Book,"I didn't realize this was a religious product, so I almost returned it.  (Not that I have anything against that, but some of the pages ask for favorite scripture, prayers for the baby, etc.). Wasn't sure that fir with out lifestyle, but the book has all the right ages for memories, so we are keeping it.",61
62,Our Baby Girl Memory Book,OMG.....we loved this baby book! Perfect for the memories you want to remember when your little one gets bigger and starts asking questions. It even had a place for foot and hand prints for when your baby is born which is the main reason why we liked this one. Also it has pockets for keepsakes and little places to put first locks of hair....etc! So cute and is a great baby shower gift!,62
63,Our Baby Girl Memory Book,"Beautiful book, I love it to record cherished times in my great granddaughters life with the beautiful pastel pink color.",63
64,Our Baby Girl Memory Book,"Really happy with this purchase. I was looking for an english baby book (I'm French and the daddy is Flammish) and this is the perfect one. Lot of info to fill in : family, firsts...and mini pockets to preserve hair, maternity bracelet...Really happy!",64
65,My Kindergarten Year - A Keepsake Book,"I was pleasantly surprised upon receiving the memory book entitled,  ""My Kindergarten Year"". It is the perfect way to record one's Kindergarten experience through photographs and detailed descriptions of this very important time in your child's life. The questions are fun for your child to answer and record while serving its purpose for the parent.I'd recommend this book to everyone with a Kindergartener.",65
66,My Kindergarten Year - A Keepsake Book,I'm so glad I stumbled upon these gem. My son has already started answering questions and I think it will be a great memory to look back years later to see how he answered the questions.,66
67,Jellycat Elephant and Mouse Book,The book is just a few pages long with a few words to each page.  Just short enough to keep the attention of my 6 month old son.  We have the Elephant as well so when he's older it will be neat to see the realization of the association between the stuffed toy and the book character,67
68,God Created Everything Nite Lite,"This is well made a very pretty,.  It gives a nice light and will be used for years...I recommend it highly.  It also makes a great gift.",68
69,Hunnt&reg; Falling Flowers and Birds Kids Nursery Home Decor Vinyl Mural Art Wall Paper Stickers,"Try this out for a spring project !Easy ,fun and affordable wall decals ...Fine quality and brightens up any room.. 5+ **********",69
70,Hunnt&reg; Falling Flowers and Birds Kids Nursery Home Decor Vinyl Mural Art Wall Paper Stickers,The reason:Small sizeHard to apply on the wall because most part of flower only in one pieceYou will know how waste money it is when second day morning you see all the flowers fell on the floor in a roll.,70
71,Wall Decor Removable Decal Sticker - Colorful Butterflies,Would not purchase again or recommend. The decals were thick almost plastic like and were coming off the wall as I was applying them! The would NOT stick! Literally stayed stuck for about 5 minutes then started peeling off.,71
72,Modern House Winnie the Pooh Swing and Tiger Swing (2 pages) removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,I could not get these Winnie the Pooh themed wall decor stickers in New Zealand and these were a very cost effective option that I was very impressed with.  They were easy to stick on and look fantastic on the wall - they don't &#34;look&#34; like stickers at all.  Very professional and very seamless on the paintwork.,72
73,Modern House Tower of Pisa Italy removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Wall Decal,"Very satisfied about the product, grat design, it came as ir said on page.  I highly reccomend the product, and I follow buying more.",73
74,Blessed By Pope Benedict XVI Divine Mercy Full Color Medal,very nice Divine Mercy Pendant of Jesus now on chain around my neck.  Love It!  Divine Mercy represents Jesuswho offers us an ocean of divine mercy.  Pray to God for our country. You need HIM in your lives!,74
75,Reusable Flannel (15) Baby Wipes 100% Cotton Bleached and Unbleached (Flushable Diaper Liners),I love these wipes.  They are so simple and soft and they are a great price for reusable wipes.  They actually get my baby clean and dry during diaper changes.  And I know that I'll find a million other uses for them after our diaper days are done.  I'm ordering more of them right now!,75
76,Beautiful Girl and Black Flower Removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"It is nice and looks great on my wall. It was just a bit smaller than what I thought, but that was my fault and not taking the measurements.",76
77,Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),We bought the pins as my 6 year old Autistic son was able to open or break open normal safety pins we needed to use for his night time clothes.  These new pins are significantly more sturdy and he hasn't learned how to open them and only once has he broken one open.  I seem to recall that their shipping price was more than a bit on the high side of reasonable though given the size of the package...,77
78,Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),These were  good quality--worked fine--heavy duty--able to be used in any way needed and filled my need as no others,78
79,Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),A great safety pin that has lots of uses.  Easy to find with bright colors and a great bargain for a dozen.,79
80,Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"While the diaper pins are attractive, the metal in the pins I received are flimsy and did not hold up to the thick fabric I used them on. Fortunately there was no baby involved, so no little on was stuck.",80
81,Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"These diaper pins went to Honduras to hold the cloth diapers we also sent with the missionaries. It is difficult to find diaper pins in our &#34;disposable&#34; age. In Honduras, they do not have &#34;Pampers&#34;. They appreciated the kits we sent.",81
82,Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"It has been many years since we needed diaper pins, but I do like to pin my socks together through the wash and have never lost one yet. I was using brass dressmaker pins but they tended to open up during the wash cycle. My wife suggested diaper pins and we tried them. Thery're working perfectly and staying together through the washing. Matter of fact they can get a little tricky to open, but of course that was the idea. Recommended to keep your socks &#34;friended up&#34;.",82
83,Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"As another reviewer noted, these are great for matching socks before washing.  Now once the socks come out of the washer, I hang them to dry with the pins still on.  The socks stay on the line to dry without clothespins, they just hang with one sock on each side of the line.  After they are dried, I just open the pin and leave it by the hamper on a shelf.  As I put dirty socks into the hamper, I grab a pin and use it.  Has saved a lot of time and I don't have the problem of lost socks or mismatched socks on my feet.  Great idea and am glad I read about this here on the reviews.  Wish I had done this my whole life.",83
84,Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"The steel part is not strong at all, unlike the old diaper pins, which I still have.  Very hard to work it through a thicker fabric.  Would not recommend.",84
85,Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),I really thought I was getting a dozen pins..turns out I should have counted the pins in the picture..as there are only 10. I am sad..and I think that they are overpriced. I only use them to mark yarn when I crochet so I will be going back to regular safety pins.,85
86,Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"Like = sharp ends that pierce through my diapers easier.  Dislike = the sides bend which is a pain.  That said, I am pushing them through older velcro tabs because the velcro on my diapers doesn't work anymore.",86
87,Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"These are the right color, so I am happy, but the steel on the needle bends easily, and is not as strong as I expected. I am pinning material for a dog bed with these, not diapers.",87
88,Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),Diaper pins are hard to find locally!  This is a useful item to have - no matter the purpose...,88
89,Wall-stickers Wall Decor Removable Decal Sticker - Giant Cherry Blossom Tree in Wind,I am pleased with the design I just wish the actual picture was bigger an putting it together doesn't make sense the numbers aligned with the branches don't make any sense compared to the picture they give you as an instruction -- you have to sort of free hand. I had to start it half way up my wall so it made a difference an could actually be seen -- as far as it hold up I put it up about 2 weeks ago an it had not peeled off at all.,89
90,Super Mario Game Nintendo Wall Sticker and Decal,These do not stick to the wall. They start to peel as soon as you stick them to the wall.,90
91,New Style Trailing Cherry Blossom Tree Decal Removable Vinyl Kids Wall Decal Wall Sticker Peel and Stick,Was so excited to get this product for my baby girls bedroom!  When I got it the back is NOT STICKY at all!  Every time I walked into the bedroom I was picking up pieces off of the floor!  Very very frustrating!  Ended up having to super glue it to the wall...very disappointing.  I wouldn't waste the time or money on it.,91
92,Blessed By Pope Francis Franciscan Knotted Our Lady of Grace Italian Made Aurora Borealis Crystal Rosary,"I ordered this Rosary for a friend because it looked lovely in the photo and it is blessed by Pope Francis.  I was not disappointed as it is just beautiful, made with crystal, and knotted in between the Our Fathers.  I am giving this to my friend along with a copy of the novena of Our Lady Untier (or Undoer) of Knots, for whom Pope Francis has a strong devotion.  I definitely recommend this Rosary and would buy it again in a heart beat.",92
93,Blessed By Pope Francis Infant Jesus of Prague Nino De Praga Medal Charm Pendant,An excellent value and quality for the price.  Just right for wearing around the neck orattaching to a Brown Scapular or some such. And the Blessing makes the Item all the more Precious.,93
94,Musical Christmas Nativity Scene Angel with Baby Jesus in a Rustic Barkwood Resin Manger 8&quot; Tall,I was so excited to get this nativity.  I have been watching it for months and I finally had an excuse to spend $25.00.  It is beautiful and I am very happy with the look of the item.  I am not so happy about the music box.  The song is WAY too fast and it had to play it through once to even recognize the song.  I don't know if there is a way to slow down a music box; if there is I wish someone would tell me.  I still love the nativity but I am not as excited as I would be if the music had been right.Buyer beware... beautiful nativity; not so great music,94
95,Semanario (7) Little Girls 14k Gold Overlay Bangle Bracelets for Your Little Princess Sizes 1 - 4 (Size 2 - ages 9-24 Months),. I am pleased with product. I love the bangles however they are a bit small. Had to slid them on with lotion. I like a snug fitting bangle but whew these were tough to get on!! If my hand was a hair bigger they wouldn't have fit. They are on to stay. I have small hands also. I got the size for large kid small adult and they fit wrist but tough over the hand. Overall satisfied with product and fast shipping!,95

100,"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",We used this to help us keep track of pees and poops during that first month. It is really helpful if you breastfeed to keep track of feeding patterns and wet diapers to make sure baby is eating enough. Great book!,100
101,"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","This book is going to be a life saver! We are adopting and when we travel complete the adoption, I needed a book to keep track of baby's schedule. I have a terrible memory and this book will be perfect for keeping track of baby's schedule. I also love how there is a spot at the beginning for emergency numbers and important info. Perfect for traveling, the babysitter or just for at home use. I will definitely be buying more after I fill this up.",101
102,"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","Love it love it love it!!  Got my first baby tracker as a gift, bought another one as soon as it was used up.  Great for daycare, too, so you can communicate with your provider about baby's activities for the day.  Also great for round the clock care- no need to ""remember"" when baby ate last or how much sleep you really got!!  Get it for your new moms- to- be!!",102
103,"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","Of course this has been a great/easy way for me to record all of my baby's routines and a simple way for his caregiver to let me know how the day went.  What I really love about it, though, is that it was so easy for me to jot down all of his major milestones as they happened.  I knew that I wouldn't have time to work on his baby book in the beginning (and sure enough I didn't even get it out until after 2 months), and because I had this book I was able to finally transfer everything over.  Life saver!!  All of the funny little things would probably have been forgotten!",103
104,"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I am 4 weeks from delivery of my first baby and was looking for a newborn tracker. From the reviews I read this one looked like it had everything that one needs to write down and remember, so I bought it. I have not used it but I am very happy with what I saw. Hope it ends up being as useful at it looks.",104
105,"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","We found this book at a rummage sale and found it to be so useful, especially when several people are helping with the baby (ex: visiting family, etc.)  We loved it so much that I've bought another one and have almost filled that one too.  I like having the room to write things about our baby's day and development, plus use the ""Notes"" section to write some story, etc.  It also helps ""Dad"" see what has happened that day and feels more connected.  I will be buying another one soon!",105
106,"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",I got this baby tracker as part of the 'new parents' package from my work. It is extremely well organized ... much better then others I've seen. It is an iParenting Media Winner and for a good reason. Absolutely worth the $$. I am getting this for all my expecting friends! 5 starts!,106
107,"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I'm a new mom and I was looking for something to record my baby's daily activities and patterns and it is perfect! It has a lot of space to write down anything extra beyond the diaper changes, feedings and sleeping. I like that it has an area to write down medications. It is a great reminder for dr appointments and to track your baby's patterns. I am extremely happy with this book and will be ordering another one for when I run out of pages in 3 months.",107
108,"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",Love this book ....super easy to keep track and sooooooooo helpful for this first time mom ..especially for pediatrician appts,108
109,"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",I loved how this book was set up to keep track of everything important about baby.  I used it for the first year.  I always took it to doctor appointments to share how often she was eating and everything.,109
110,"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",I've been using it since I have my newborn and it's a great way to keeping track of baby&#34;s schedule,110
111,"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I used a tracker with my first son - but I didn't so much need to with my second.  This tracker though, is laid out very well and keeps things pretty organized.  My only complaint is that it is not a full year tracker - I did the whole first year with my first son which is nice to refer back to.  I would recommend this book, but if you're interested in tracking the whole first year you will need to buy 3 (they run 4 months long).",111
112,"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","This is the best way to keep track of when your baby eats, sleeps, poops, gets a bath, etc. It's also a great way to keep track of which side baby nursed on. I took this to all infant doc appt. And it's a great gift!",112
113,"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","I rarely write a review however, this journal has been a lifesaver.  Sleep deprivation can compromise anyones ability to recall feeding and napping times, which breast was last used, soiled diapers, etc.. I even sleep with my journal to keep it close by so I can document around the clock.  The layout of this journal is very simple and easy to use at a quick glance.  I understand there are phone apps that do the same thing however, I chose this journal to allow my husband and nanny to have access to the information.  A must have and will make a great gift.",113
114,"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book",I received this at my baby shower and it has been a wonderful gift. I had no idea when I received it what fun it would be to record all this information. I have done this for 2 children now and only wish I would have had it for my first 2 kids.,114
115,"Large Jungle Animals (Panda, Lion, Elephant, Gorilla) - 3D Wall Murals for Baby Nursery and Kids Rooms - Made in USA",I ordered these for my 7 month old sons play area.  They are very cool.  I love the fact that they can be removed from the wall and moved to a room or house if needed.  I would get these instead of wall decals because they are 1. easier to put up and 2. can be moved without ruining them.  It makes his play area look really cool!,115
116,Edu-Petit Happy Jungle Day Finger Puppet Book Developmental Toy,My 2 year old grandson got it for Christmas and he loves when his Mommy reads it to him.  Good quality and very well made.  Other positive reviews directed me to buy it.,116
117,Edu-Petit Teddy Bobo's Big Learning Book Developmental Toy,"I bought this for my 17 month old son as a form of quiet, in-crib entertainment when he wakes up at 5am. So far, he likes it a lot... even got an ""ooooooh"" when I first handed it to him.",117
118,Modern House Thomas Train and Friends removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"i hung these over my sond headboard in his thomas themed room, they havent fallen off the wall, applied a week ago so maybe they will be okay but they seemed kinda cheaply made. they do look good and as i said they havent fallen down, if they do i will be sure to revise my review to avoid anyone else making my mistake.",118
119,Modern House White Plum Blossom with Green Birds Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"a little difficult if you dont know how you want it to be placed on your wall, so be creative, it comes off easily so you can play around with it.. the result looks beautiful. very peaceful.",119

121,Modern House Trailing Cherry Blossom Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,well its not as big as it looks in the picture but it is awfully cute looking. actually is only about one foot tall.,121
122,Modern House Trailing Cherry Blossom Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,I haven't put these up yet but I was disappointed in the color of the flowers. They look more purple than pink.,122
123,Modern House Safari Animal Family removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"the instructions were really clear, howerver the next day the decals started coming off because my wall has ridges on it soooo. I added a little dab of crazy glue and walah! it's up.",123
124,Modern House Safari Animal Family removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,The designs were cut and easy to apply. There was no sticky residue when we peeled it off to readjust and it was to redo the adjustment again and again. It was also just sticky enough to stick to the wall while not too sticky enough to peel the paint off. We like it.,124
125,Modern House Angry Bird I removable Vinyl Mural Art Wall Sticker Decal,"Grandchildren opened these before they got home and stuck them to everything in my house, even themselves. Hope they will still stick on wall when they get home.",125
126,Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,My daughter started playing with her Music Blocks set when she was just a few months old.  She spent hours entertaining herself.  She is now 18 months old and still loves this toy.  Now she understands how to arrange the blocks and has great fun making new musical patterns.  I highly recommend the Jumpin' Jive Jazz cartridge -- it's her favorite -- and the Bach cartridge when you want calmer music.,126
127,Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"It takes a youthful spirit of inquiry and fascination to play with blocks and pre-programmed music. Anyone too old to play with blocks (or to young to play with them again) may back off. But they're missing a revolution in interactive toys. Each colored block represents part of a musical score, and each side on the block represents one way of delivering that piece, such as horn, violin, or voice. Turning and swapping blocks thus generates changes in the music played, with incredible variety. You (and, oh yes, the child too) will run out of steam long before you run out of interest. And the use of additional block sets expands the use and interest even more. Bravo!!",127
128,Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,This was one of my favorite toys-but beware if you buy this I went through 3 of these- and the company no longer exists-so if there is a problem with it-you are out of luck,128
129,Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"Our whole family loved the Mozart music blocks. I even bought another &quot;disk&quot; of music. Unfortunately, it was a constant challenge to keep the kids from destroying the delicate &quot;chip&quot; that was easily accessible. Finally it broke and I felt it was too expensive to replace. I feel that a toy at this price should be more durable. My suggestion would be to hide the &quot;plug in chip&quot; so that the kids aren't attracted to it. We have a 3-year old and a one-year old. The toy lasted about 6 months.",129
130,Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"This is an interesting and educational toy.  I got it for my 2 year old, and while she loved mixing up the blocks, she also loved pulling out the cartridge and couldn't put it back in.  That means I had to go put the cartridge back every 5 minutes.  If the cartridge were placed on the side or back, I don't think the littler ones would be so inclined to pull it...out of sight out of mind.",130
131,Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"Great idea, but the toy IS NOT durable.  After returning one toy for not working, another one has broken.  What a disappointment!!  And the customer service is non-existant and when it is, they are rude!!!! Someone let me know when the class-action lawsuit will occur.",131
132,Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,I bought this 18 months ago for my 6 year old and 2 year old.  They both loved it.  I bought additional cartridges then it stopped working.  We replaced the batteries twice and it still does not work.  It was expensive for a toy that did not last very long.,132
133,Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"I spent [a lot of money] when this thing first came out, and it worked TERRIBLY!  I sent it back to the company because it was defective and wouln't shut up.  They sent me another one.  It worked very inconsistently.  When I called the manufacturer I was told ""Well, it's a very sensitve computer, you can't just let them toss it around, that must be why you're having trouble""  Actually, I was having my 2 year sit in his high chair while I supervised him, and he was not doing anything to it.  I mean, it says it's for 2 year olds on the box....  Anyway, I returned it and got my money.  SAve your money for real music lessons.",133
134,Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,Recently I have purchased the musical mozart blocks set for my two and a half year old daughter at a toys r us department store near me as a Christmas gift for her this year and they had one of the toys out on display. She loved the toy and it is very educational. I had a hard time leaving the store because she wanted to continue to play with it although she is young enough that even though she was with me while I purchased her toys for Christmas this year that she had completely forgotten about it and that I haought this toy for her. My only complaint is that I had to pay [$$$] for this toy and they had told me that the sale on the toy had ended yesterday but this toy I knew was still available online here for [$$$] which is a really good price and I do not think it is right for them to sell it for the other price when it can be bought cheaper. Anyways I liked the toy alot and my daughter did too and that is why I purchased the toy even at the price I  had to pay for it. I think it will get a lot of use out of it and so will my 8 month old daughter when she is old enough as well.,134
135,"Milestones, Kids' Step Stone Kit",Product was very easy to use.  I helped my son (16 months at the time) make a stepping stone for Father's Day.  He put the stones in himself and it turned out really cute.,135
136,Sesame Street Baby Purse Playset,"My girls love this Sesame Street purse! There are 5 items that can be placed inside of the purse. They use it when they pretend to go shopping around the house. It was a little tricky for my 18 month old to figure out how to open it but she eventually learned. The bright colors, durable design and sweet Sesame Street character faces make it such a fun purchase!",136
137,my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I bought this for my son when he was 4 months old.  He loves all the little animals, but even now at 8 months, he doesn't seem interested in putting them in the fish bowl.  However, he will take them out if they are in there.  My son is very active, so maybe that's contributing to why he doesn't really use the bowl...",137
138,my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,I purchased this item for my son and its going to be returned the star fish he cant hold on to the fish the only thing he can hold on to was the crab and he liked that because it crinkled.. This is not Our favorite Lamaze toy and it will be going back to the store..,138
139,my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"My one-year-old baby loves this toy!  She loves to take the fish in and out, and watch through the transparent sides as she takes them in and out.  She loves to play peek-a-boo through the sides.  She loves to shake/squeeze each fish to hear its noise.  Downside: the fish are easy to misplace, so keeping all four together is a challenge.",139
140,my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I bought this toy to help stimulate my eight-month-old's development. When I got it in the mail, I immediately opened it and gave it to her. She has been playing with it since. Her favorite is the crinkle crab because she can make him make noise. She is fascinated by the others. She very quickly learned how to take them out and put them back into the bowl. She has had no difficulty in doing that. Great item, worth the money!! And it is so fun to watch!!",140
141,my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"Everyone knows nap time can be difficult, my daughter fights it everyday, sometimes she'll even jump around and hit the sides of her crib. We decided putting some of those cribside toys made of hard plastic was unrealistic at this point, however I saw this and got it right away.Although we had tried stuffed animals and other soft toys this works he best. It's a lot more interactive compared with just hugging her teddy bear. Everyday she plays with it, it also occupies her in the morning when she first wakes. I walk into her room and there she is holding her fishy. Plus if she rolls on it during the night there's no chance of hurting herself. She loves it.Great value! Something a little different.",141
142,my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,This is a very good toy that helps manual dexterity and the ability to recognize figures behind the clear plastic. My baby girl especially loves the crinkle crab and the clam !,142
143,my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,We first bought this toy for our oldest child when she was just beginning to sit up and play with toys.  She would sit in her crib and play for a hour or more just putting the sea creatures in and out.  It gave Mommy shower and make-up time!  We believe she loved the clear plastic on the bowl and the shape and feel of the pieces.  We had the same experience with daughter #2.  We have bought this several times for other new parents.  Our girls have also received similar toys (not Lamaze) ex: a cookie jar and have not enjoyed it anywhere near as much.  A little toy with big entertainment value!,143
144,my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I saw this toy before I was pregnant and though it was so cute!So after I had my daughter, I had the best excuse to buy it!!!She loves it.  I bought it for her when she was about 3 months old.  She'd chew on the little clam.  Now she uses it to learn that they make noise, and she can put them in and take them out of the bowl.It's worth the money.  Cute, educational, (quiet.. heh), and durable.",144
145,my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"We received this as a present for our 6 month old.  I don't really think she's old enough to put the individual toys in the fishbowl, but she sure loves playing with them!  I've noticed that she likes &quot;crinkly&quot; toys, so she loves the crab.  So far, it has kept her very entertained.  I really like Lamaze products so far",145
146,my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I bought this toy for my baby and for friends' babies as well. The babies really love the faces on the toys and get a kick out of the different sounds each one makes. They enjoy looking at them through the clear plastic and taking them out and putting them back in over and over. Most kids seem fascinated by ocean creatures anyway, so I think it's bound to be a guaranteed &quot;hit&quot; for any child. My 2 1/2 year old still loves to play with the crab!",146
147,my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"This toy was given to my son by his grandmother.  I saw Lamaze and immediately thought it would be a great toy.  Not the case.My son received this fish bowl when he was about 4 months old.  He is now 9 months.  He chews on the crab for hours, but other than that not much else.  I feel that this is an expensive teething toy.I like the variety of color and the different textures of fabric the toy offers.",147
148,my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I bought this for my son when he was 6mos.  He LOVED it!  What great little teethers each of the sea creatures make.  However, 1.5mos down the road, he totally ignored it.  It was beyond his developmental path.  Cute toy, but I'm not sure it's worth it.",148
149,Pedal Farm Tractor,"We chose this tractor and trailer for a family gift for our two-year-old son and he loves it!  Visiting friends love it, too.  We looked at several others, but this one seemed to be the safest and most durable.  He cannot pedal the tractor yet, but loves to push it around or be pushed while sitting on it and will soon grow to it (he is tall).  The trailer is a great addition and our son loves to fill it with toys (or his little brother!).  The only negative is that the ""hitch"" for the trailer does not lock in place and can be turned causing the trailer to come off at bad times, but we would still recommend it.  The assembly was easy and our little farmer has been thrilled!",149
150,Pedal Farm Tractor,I bought this for my son when he was 3 years old.  He is now 8 and handed it down to my younger son when he turned 2.  After 5 years of rough and tough riding it is just now starting to break down.  This has been an awesome toy.  We also purchased the trailer and the boys have loved them both.  I think it would have lasted even longer if my 8 year old would have stayed off of it after he had outgrown it.  Anyway the only thing you need to keep in mind is that there is no brake so be careful on hills.,150
151,Pedal Farm Tractor,"We bought this tractor to accompany the trailer.  Our grandsons are big into farm stuff and love to load up the trailer and pretend they are working """"on the farm.""""  It is best for those old enough to reach the pedals (age 3 and up?).  It is very sturdy and durable.  Great toy for those busy toddlers and preschoolers.  Worth every penny it cost!",151
152,Pedal Farm Tractor,"We bought this tractor for our 2 and a half-year-old son, and he is able to pedal and manuever this vehicle very well, despite the recommended age of 3-6 years. This tractor is very sturdy, and nearly impossible to tip over. My son has deserted all other riding toys in favor of this tractor. I highly recommend purchasing the yellow trailer that is specifically made for this tractor, but is sold separately .... My son loads all kinds of treasures into the trailer and farms the yard for long periods of time....",152
153,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"We bought these for our son when he turned two. He had seen them at a playmate's home and LOVED them. I liked them b/c unlike some of the other cars for sale...there is some learning value and they are VERY durable. They have been thrown, rolled, stepped on, etc and still show no signs of wear. Highly recommend!",153
154,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My son loves stacking cups, so a friend recommended this toy to me.  My son loves it and he enjoys pushing them around the floor.  They nest nicely into each other, which makes it a great toy for the diaper bag.",154
155,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My son Cameron just loves these great little stacking cars!  He enjoys stacking them and slapping them down and each has great little things that they do such as his fire truck has a ladder that clicks up and down, police car has a spinning &quot;light&quot; bar, and so on.  I think it's great, brightly colored and has great little faces....I would give this as a gift in the future, not a wasted toy, Oh the little wheels roll, too!",155
156,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My one year old son received these as a birthday gift. He loves them. Not only are they stackable, which helps with hand-eye coordination, but each car has individual moveable features. Although these features are small, they got his attention. The bright colors are nice also. They are a great buy for the price!  I highly recommend them as first trucks for a small child.",156
157,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,I purchased this toy for my great grandson's first Christmas. He will be 6 months old. I can't wait to play with it with him. This is the first baby in our family for 18 years and all the family is waiting for the fun... I will be ordering a lot more soon. Thank you for the convenient shopping. AJ'S Gee-Gee (Great Grandmom),157
158,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I've owned this set for several years.  My 4 granddaughters love to play with the cars.  Stacking, nesting, playing with the few moving parts.  It is one of their favorite toys when they come over.  And it is definitely one of mine - Lots of play value that stores very well.  They have learned colors, and numbers with these also.",158
159,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"These are a huge hit with my one year old son.  We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born.  He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We've traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don't take up much space since they nest.  The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands.",159
160,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"This is a great toy.  The wheels really work and each car has a special feature.  They store easily for packing on trips and putting away.  Both of my kids (boy and girl) have played with them.  They are brightly colored.  And best of all, these do not use batteries!",160
161,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My 11 month old received these last Christmas and he instantly began running them along the floor and playing with them. He is now 22 months and I have taught him his colors using these and he STILL loves to play with them.  One got run over by an electric scooter and it didn't even break! All parents should get these for your baby.  This is the one toy that will NOT sit and collect dust!,161
162,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My 14 month old son loves to stack and play with these little cars.  They are durable and easy to clean.  I throw them in  the diswasher and they hold up great.  They are well worth the money to me.,162
163,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"Great toys, we always pack one or two in the diaper bag, our 7 month old loves to play with them and I don't worry at all about him chewing on these toys as there are only smooth surfaces",163
164,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My son has played with these from 6 months old, and still likes them occasionally (18 months now).  The small car is nice for babies to shake.  They don't do much, but they are cute.",164
165,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,After being inundated with toys that require batteries and make so much noise this was a breath of fresh air. My son loves these vehicles! We got this when he was 6 months old. We stack them on top and he loves to knock it over. We nest them and he loves to find the surprise vehicle underneath. Now that he is 8 months old he is figuring out that the wheels move as well as some of the other moving features on each vehicle. I highly recommend this toy.,165
166,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I bought these for my 1 1/2 year old, and he loves them (and so does his 5-year old brother). They both stack the cars, hide them and ""vrroomm"" them. It is great to find a toy that doesn't need batteries or require an engineering degree to put together!Highly recommended.",166
167,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,We bought these trucks for our 15 mo. old daughter and 4 mo. old son- We love them!  They are nesting which is fun for our daughter to look underneath the trucks to find the next one or they can stack one on top of the other to make a tower.  Perfect first trucks!  And they aren't too big- a perfect size!,167
168,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My son got this stacking truck set as a baby gift.  He was able to play with the trucks at about 6 months and they are still played with today (my son will be 2 next month). The overall durability of this toy is great; they look as good as when we got them even after lots of play and being taken along on many trips. I have not seen this toy in any store - so get it here while you still can!  It has been a much used toy and I highly recommend it for your small child.,168
169,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I bought the cars because they were easy to store, plus they were cars.  What I have found is that I can actually use then in many places since there is more than one vehicle.  Mostly they are easy to pack for a trip.",169
170,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My daughter loves these vehicles. She likes to watch them disappear as you stack them inside each other. And she loves to stack them atop of each other. Then she plays with them as cars, and even makes the sounds they make. They are wonderful fun toys, and great to take with you on trips, they are compact!",170
171,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My son loves this stacking toy. It is much more fun than the stackable rings toy even though he does have that one too. All the boys at our baby group have it and the babies who don't always come up to see what it is all about! You can't go wrong with this purchase.,171
172,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I got this toy for my daughter when she was very little.  She really hasn't been interested until recently.  Now she loves to put little people inside the cars and look at them through the top.  She lets objects play hide-and-seek under the cars but she really doesn't stack them or nest them very much.  I think they are worth the money because they were fairly cheap but she hasn't really used them for the intended purpose.  I don't think I would buy them again but I certainly wouldn't take them back if they were given to me. I think my daughter will use them in different ways with other toys, in the tub or pool or even outside as she grows.  They are extremely durable.",172
173,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"Okay, well they don't really beep.  (But my 11-month old son loves when we roll these along and SAY &quot;beep beep!&quot;)  At this point, my son's favorite aspect of these cars is the little sunroof, siren and ladder on the tops.  He can sit there for ten minutes just flipping the sunroof back and forth!  Go figure!  These cars are super sturdy and have taken quite a beating on our coffee table.  (They're in much better shape than the coffee table at this point.)  I love that they nest together so they don't take up too much space when they're put away.  I also like that he can grow into them once he understands the nesting/stacking part better.  A great toy...gets played with each and every day!",173
174,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"For well over a year my son has enjoyed stacking and playing with these cars. They have held up brilliantly to his abuse - they still look like new. Fun to stack, fun to roll. Clever toy that has been a winner with my son since he was one.",174
175,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"We just bought this for my 9 month old daughter,she loves these cars, loves to turn the wheels and lookat the faces. She especially loves the little green car,it's the perfect size to fit in her tiny hand and it rattles.This toy is a hit! I highly recommend it.",175
176,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My son got this for Christmas and he loves all the cars.  His favorite is the fire truck.  He plays with it for a while.,176
177,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item.",177
178,Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control,"My mother-in-law bought 2 of these for our twin boys-- one for each crib-- and they have been a life saver in getting our boys to settle down at night and go to sleep. Now our boys do not sleep without it! Anytime we are going somewhere overnight, we take at least one with us. It is also the only toy that plays music by itself for more than 30 sec. It will play for about 10 minutes!! It's our standard gift for all of our parent friends.",178
179,Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control,"My daughter had this in her crib until she was 2 and loved it.  When she got old enough she loved to turn it on and off by herself.  I used this every night for her to go to sleep by. I used the place that you store the remote control in for extra pacifiers, so if she lost one during the night she would know where to find one.  I never used the remote, but loved the idea another had about putting in the car for rear facing infants when they get fussy you could just turn it on with the remote.  It's not too bright and the volume is adjustable.  Someone had said it eat batteries quickly,but I found that they lasted a very LONG time and I used it EVERY night. I highly recommend this product!!",179
180,Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control,I bought this product when my son was about 10 months old.  He was still having problems going to sleep at night and naptime.  The Slumbertime Soother is great.  I sing along with the songs.  My son turns it on himself and sometimes just plays with it.  The nature sounds relax him.  I really like the fact that it plays for ten minutes without stopping.,180

182,Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"i bought this beautie at k mart for 5 bucks. other that the suction cup not really working out well, my 3 month old loves it. hell, my husband and i also enjoy playing with it. it has a variey of colours and shapes that help stimulate the mind. you cant lose.",182
183,Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"I bought this to use on the high chair, but within 2 days my son had the rattle part off the base. Needless to say it never went back on for more than 5 min. BUT he did enjoy it in the car and other places.",183
184,Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"My son loved this toy.  He enjoyed playing with it in his highchair until he was 10 months old.  At that point he was strong enough to pull the toy from its' base.  He pulled it so hard, he smashed himself in the face with it.  After that upsetting experience, we didn't put it in the base anymore.  He did still play with it as a rattle, but it did not hold his attention as well.  I would like to see this toy redesigned so that it cannot be separated from its' base.",184
185,Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"My son is nearly a year old and received this toy about 9 months ago.  We both love Sassy toys.  This one is bright and amusing.  Stick it on a car window, high chair tray, restaurant table, bathroom tile,...  We were disappointed in the life of the suction cup, but for all other reasons--color, amusement, education, and co-ordination--get one of these!",185
186,Sassy Smiley Face Rattle,"This toy is very cute, it has two handles for little hands to grasp, a mirror on one side and on the other the smiley face! the face has wiggly eyes and a nose to beep. but the nose can be frusterating for babies as my 18month old son still has a hard time beeping it! my all in all a cute,durable toy!!",186
187,Sassy Circle Rattle,My son (who is now 2+ yrs) loved this rattle as a baby.  He loved it so much that I have given it to all of my mommy- friends as a gift.  This is the best toy to have for a young baby.  You will get them to smile for those all-important-photos with this one!!,187
188,Sassy Circle Rattle,"Both of my sons love this toy. My two year old played with it when he was a baby, and it found its way to the bottom of his toy box at Granny's. We found it about a month ago and his 5 month old baby brother began to play with it. Suprise Suprise he loves it too! And his big brother tries to steal it away. This toy is durable, and fun. What more could mom ask for??",188
189,Sassy Circle Rattle,"What I don't love about this is that the clear part, where the baby can watch the beads move with motion, contains BPA.  However, my daughter found this rattle a comfort to her while teething and chewed only the big protruding ball, which as far as I know is free from both PVC and BPA.  I thought she would like the textures of the rings, but nope, it was all about the ball.Also appreciated the bright colors.  This is a good bang for your buck baby toy -- for a while there we always had it in the diaper bag when we left the house.Best at about 6-12 months.  Can't see it getting a lot of use before 3 months and just not interesting to a toddler, even a toddler who is still teething.",189
190,Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,"I was concerned about the chemical content of this ""plastic"" book since a baby will undoubtedly stick it in his mouth. I emailed Sassy and got a reply saying that this was BPA, PVC and Phtalates free. I can breathe a sigh of relief when I hand this to our baby...soon!",190
191,Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,"We bought this for our 5 month old and put pictures of relatives that live far away inside the pages.  The book is very sturdy, &quot;chewable&quot; and has a lot of great colors/designs to look at.  Now at 8 months, this book is still one her favorites!  Plus she sees her grandma's and grandpa's, etc, faces every day.  We love it.",191
192,Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,I bought this for a new granddaughter.  I will not get to see her often as she lives in another state.  This book is great for out pictures and she can carry it around and look at the pictures as she would a book.  This way she can recognize us when we show up.  It is easy to carry and cleaning it is simple.  It is a great little photo book.,192
193,Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,"I originally bought this for my 4 month old son, but my 17 month old daughter has taken it over.  We filled it with pictures of mom and dad, 2 sets of grandparents, and all the cousins with their families (there are only 6 slots for pics, but we took pictures of entire families - so we have 20 people in all).  She loves pointing to the pictures and identifying various people.  The pages are made out of thin plastic material and filled with foam, so are pretty soft, but still durable. The slots are sized for 3x5 inch pictures.  My 4 month old hasn't gotten much out of it yet, but I'm sure he'll love it just as much in months to come.",193
194,Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,This is a nice photo book for babies as it has clear plastic sleeves to protect the pictures you place inside.,194
195,Sassy Who Loves Baby? Photo Album Book with teether handle,"Based on articles on the dangers of PVC plastic books, this book was tested and found to contain chemicals that are highly toxic for babies and toddlers. This materials have already been banned from children's toys in Europe.In order to read the many articles online that specifically name this book as having been found to contain chemicals that are dangerously toxic for children, google ""toxic bath books"" or the title of the book with the word ""toxic.""This book's concept is wonderful, but those who love children should share photos in another kind of album or book.",195
196,Earlyears: Earl E. Bird with Teething Rings,"We received an Earl E. Bird as a gift when we had our first baby eleven years ago. Since then, Earl has seen us through teething for three kids, and is still in good condition for our fourth baby!  He's a little faded around the edges, but just as loveable and soft, with difference textures for a chewy, drooly baby to gnaw on.I like that he's fully washable, and a nice quiet toy (at least in ours, the squeaker was very quiet to begin with and has since kind of stopped squeaking--but the squeaker was never the big attraction with Earl).  Perfect for taking on planes, or in church, or in the car. A great baby shower gift, since Earl is perfect for a boy or a girl.",196

203,"My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children","Got this for a plane ride 3 months ago. The snaps are hard to snap and he gets frustrated. Most pieces are attached to the book which is nice, he can't lose them. He flips thru it but that is about it. Maybe when we travel again he will find it more interesting. We keep it for trips only so it will be ""new"" each time. He has seen it up on the shelf and asks for it but when we give it to him he is done flipping thru in a few minutes and it is left on the floor for other books.",203

210,Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,"I ordered this book for the up-coming birthday of a grandson. It really is cute and an excellent quality. It comes with a small stuffed bear that you can remove from the book. Each page of the book has a different night-time activity for the bear to do such as have a glass of milk, brush his teeth etc. I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting because even though it is a quality toy I'm not sure that Liam will use it enough to make it worth the price I paid.  The Pockets of Learning toys all seem to be very high quality if somewhat pricy.",210
211,Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,"Both of my boys liked playing with this book.  They also liked to take the bear out and play with him.  The pajamas are a little hard to put on, but they didn't seem to care much.  My youngest actually has slept with the little bear!",211
212,Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,"This book is very cute, and despite other comments I found it to be well made. My son is not real interested though but maybe he will later on. I just think that it doesn't have enough pages and interactivity for the price you are paying.",212
213,Lullaby and Goodnight by Pockets of Learning,"This is a cute, interactive book made out of fabric. It walks you though the night routine (1. Drink your milk, 2. Brush your teeth, 3. Take off your clothes, 4. take a bath, 5. Put on pajamas, 6. Bedtime story, 7. Say a prayer, 8. Lullaby and goodnight) - works well for praying people - unfortunately, I bought it for an agnostic family!",213
214,Baby Monitor - Direct Link Privacy Monitor,"Considering how horrible the selection is these days for choosing a quality baby monitor that doesn't transmit to anyone and everyone who may be listening in, intentionally or unintentionally, this seems to be one of the best choices to make.  Your scrambled voice will sound like Donald Duck on a regular analog 46-49 mhz cordless phone or radio scanner, so it's at least a moderate roadblock for the average signal interceptor.  However, why on earth there is no 900 mhz (or higher) digital-spread-spectrum baby monitor on the market is beyond me.  So, this unit is one of the better compromises out there, and at ... on amazon.com, it is amazingly affordable.",214

The chime is pleasant, not annoying and this ball is easy for a baby to pick up and manipulate.  It is my understanding that the Sassy line is BPA and Phalate free, so you dont have to worry about your child putting this toy in her mouth.",220

224,Pooh Baby's First Tigger,"I actually got the ""Pooh"" one which for some reason is not advertised on babiesrus.com/amazon.I believe that toys like this sometimes are more for the parents as opposed to the babies, but still it is a cute toy!  It went with my newborn son everywhere we went because it fit perfectly with him in his carrier and it was a cute, small toy we could use to interact with.  At 9-months-old he's not at that age where he's hugging, chewing, just all out playing with his toys and he likes it for that reason.  But babies need more that just stuffed animals.  He's obviously much more interested in toys that make sounds or light so his Pooh mostly stays in his room with the other 'dolls'.This is still a cute item.  I haven't had to wash it yet, but it sure is durable.",224
225,Pedella Wooden Push Toy,"This is a must have for any toddler!  I bought one for my brothers triplets who were 1 1/2 years old at the time.  They loved it!  One would push & the other 2 would chase after it.  They love watching the duck waddle & its feet go round & round.  Best of all, no batteries!  Yaayyyy!!Fifteen years ago, I bought my daughter a little push clown from the same company.  It was her favorite toy & was passed onto her brother.  With heavy playing by 2 children it never lost any of its paint or parts.  It's something we are saving for grandchildren one day.",225
226,Infant Stim-mobile,"Love this mobile!  It is challenging and their eyes are drawn to it.  My son couldn't look at it until he got older as he didn't like high contrast, but at @ 7 mo he got into it.  If you are a parent who appreciates observing the small nuances of learning that occur in the development process--you will be able to witness it with this toy.  I'm not a parent trying to turn my children into geniuses, but definitely into maximizing their capabilities to incite their own curiosities.  Keeping children zoned out is not a priority--so for those who want to do that--turn on the tv and buy toys with bells and whistles.  For others, get toys like this one.",226
227,Infant Stim-mobile,"We found this at a garage sale and I read about it and it seemed really interesting so I bought it. This is for the first few months of a baby's life and should not move much, contrary to what the first poster said, because you want stimulation but you don't want to over-stimulate a baby. However, we did notice that sometiems our baby does like the mobile to move and it is summer here but the air conditioner blowing air around the room should be enough movement. When it's not moving, we can just put a small fan on its lowest setting about 6 feet from the crib and the small wiggling was enough movement to keep her stimulated but not so much movement that she can't keep track of the object (babies this young are not good at tracking so you don't want a lot of motion), but still we only do this once in a while, not at all times.One of the best things about this mobile is that our baby only wakes us up at night to feed. If she wakes herself up she will sit and stare at it for a long time and be happy since we have a small nightlight in the room. Any time we put her in the crib we can see her staring at the simple shapes. Shown in the picture on the product page is the detailed shapes, you flip the cardboard from the simple to the detailed shapes when they are about 2 months old, then remove this mobile for a more 'traditional' one with movement and objects the baby can grab at about 4 months. This is a somewhat delicate mobile since it uses air currents to move, so you need to keep it safe from a grabbing/eating baby.Also, one nice feature is that ours came with a travel pack, or at least that's how I'm using it. Besides the crib mount, there is an 8 inch circular plastic ring with fishing wire for hanging the mobile. You can hang it anywhere with a string, either taping string to the ceiling or tying it to any overhang. It also came with a cardboard carrying case thing which is very thin and easy to take with you on a trip.For those with a math/science background, it's really interesting to note that first side of the cards have objects with very low spatial frequency. The 'detailed' sides are actually the same patterns, but with a moderately higher spatial frequency. After 4 months, you use standard mobiles, which have very high spatial frequencies, as well as colors and things the baby can grab to improve hand-eye coordination. Basically, you start showing the child very low frequency objects that are easy to observe and track, then gradually move up until they can use the high frequency information.Now, I want to explain why I did not give this item 5 stars even though it's an amazing product. Before my baby was a month old, I noticed that she was already able to detect some colors and this stim-mobile is only black and white. This is from 1990, so I guess over the last 20 years they have refined the product so that the simple side has some red (first color a baby sees) and other simple colors, while the reverse side has more vivid colors, but uses the same idea of going from low spatial frequencies to higher spatial frequencies. I ordered the newest version but still kept this around for changing table and pack n play entertainment since she loves it. If I had not known about the improved version, I would have given it 5 stars, but there is something better available so I highly recommend getting the updated version for every newborn.",227
228,Fisher Price - Baby Bowling,I'm really disappointed with this toy.  It never kept my daughter's attention.,228
229,Fisher Price - Baby Bowling,"Cute toy, durable and is simple. Nothing sings, light up or dances...just what our kids truly need. Everything talks, spins, lights up....it is hard to find SIMPLE stimulation toys that kids have to manipulate themselves. This set challenges kids mentally as they try to figure out a. how to roll a ball b. how to aim the ball c. how to knock the pins down d. how to pick up the wobbly little guys. also you can tell your child 'aim for the red guy' or 'aim for the yellow guy'. great for teaching basic colors and counting too. don't forget you can always say WOW you knocked ONE over...and so forth. great all around and gets tossed around too so clearly after using for a month and being bashed on teh floor by little hands trying to figure out how to bounce the not bouncy ball (exploration) nothing has broken.",229

231,Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,"This product was very innovative when introduced in 1997-8.  It sold at FAO Schwarts for about $100 and we got it for our 18 month old daughter.  She used it until she was at least 3 (we then moved to Reader Rabbit).  The way it worked then -  you plugged the key board into the printer port and the sw was on two CDs. The keyboard did not require mouse skills, just visual selection of very large buttons.  Very interactive, very educational for the toddler/preschool set.  The developer was Israeli and they did not have good US distribution.  It now seems that they finally found someone to distribute it.",231
232,Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,"I have to say, the first time we played with this I thought it was going to be a dud and I was thinking I would send it back.  It's very simple and not much interaction to it.  But it turns out my 2 year old daughter loves it.  She gets a kick out of it and it's all she needs in a toy.(This is the Comfy PC and not the Elmo toy.)",232
233,Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,"My daughter loves this product! It covers her 2 favorite things the PC and the phone! Whenever I am on the computer she is always on my lap trying to push whatever keys she can, but with this I can put her in her highchair and put her in front of the PC and she will entertain herself for at least an hour!  She espicially loves the phone aspect on the side and what I love is there is no cord to worry about. I would definitely reccommend this to anyone with a toddler, I started using this with my daughter when she was 12 months old, she is now 15 months and loves it more now that she has gone up to another level!",233

235,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I've tried this for almost 6 months at different points of our kid teething and she's just not that into this. It's really heavy for a baby. When I would hold the vibrating setting on my kid would watch for a bit and even try it but just seemed bored with it and would move on. The yellow part also attracts dust and fiber out of the air like a magnet. It is ALWAYS dirty. I'm not that particular when it comes to dirt and baby stuff but it grosses me out. It's also only wire clean, so it's a more high maintenance toy.",235
236,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"This teether is ridiculous. It's huge, it's hard to clamp down on, and my daughter had no idea what was going on when it started vibrating in her mouth.It's just too big, awkward, and hard to push down on. Not worth the money, in my opinion.",236
237,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,One of my friends recommended this for me for my daughter when she was teething. It was the only thing that made her stop crying when she was teething and I tried everything imaginable. I had to hold it to make it vibrate because her mouth wasn't strong enough but it made her so happy and cuddly that is far from a complaint. Have recommended it to lots of my friends and they all love it.,237

My daughter is 10-months-old and her first tooth just came through, and we'd tried everything to soothe her gums: ice cubes, teething rings, cold washcloths, you name it. At first she wasn't terribly interested in the toy, but then I took it and put it in my mouth and handed it back to her. She put it in her mouth, and I squeezed the other side to make it vibrate. The look on her face was priceless! Her eyebrows went up and I noticed she bit down harder (so I could let go), and she seemed to really like the vibration. This has since become her go-to toy when her gums seem to bother her. Also, I discovered she likes to have the little roller on the handle rubbed up and down her back. All in all this is a really well made toy that worked for my daughter exactly how I'd hoped.",239
240,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,my 5mth old daughter really likes this teething toy. it has just the right amount of vibration and it triggered easily enough where she can activate it herself with little effort. i like that the 3 sides of the star have different ribbing so it feels different on her gums. great product for the money and a must have for a teething baby.,240
241,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My 10 month old grandson thought the movement of this toy was funny! He laughs when it moves! Saying this, he does put it in his mouth but pulls it out to laugh So, I love this Teether because it makes him so happy NOT because it massages his teeth!",241
242,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My four month old started teething around two months, he has pretty impressive motor skills when it comes to using his hands but this teether is huge and you really have to apply quite a bit of pressure for it to vibrate. My other son who is two and also teething shows absolutely no intrest in this at all. Maybe in a couple more months....",242
243,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,It is a good teether for my handicapped student. But the ability to bit down is required which is hard for my student.,243
244,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"It is a great toy for them to chew and play with, but it is a bit harder for smaller babies to chew on. The vibration was a bit stronger than I was expecting, but it does not seem to bother my son a bit.",244
245,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My daughter is two months and loves this in her mouth.  She seem to like the points and the softer rubber than theInfantino Vibrating Strawberry Teether.  Also it requires less pressure to make vibrate.  No she is not teething yet and no she cannot make it vibrate yet.  But if you pinch it for her, their are three different point surfaces and yes she has her favorite.  If she is getting a bit cranky, there are times this will turn her back into all smiles.  At this point, she seems to ""chew"" and vigorously suck on the points.",245
246,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,This is a good idea but it takes a lot of pressure for my 7 month old granddaughter to make it vibrate.  I can squeeze one corner to make it vibrate while she chews on the other end.  Otherwise she chews it like a regular teething you.,246
247,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"The older one of these lasted us several years for my special needs daughter who likes the vibration. This one lasted 3 months before the battery died. Folks, you need to work on battery life or just go back to the old style teether!",247
248,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"A must in addition to all the teething toys. Next to Sophie the giraffe this is his favorite. I. Don't really know if the vibration massages. His gums, but he does enjoy biting into it a lot!",248
249,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My little guy loves his star teether! It's great entertainment for him, and he likes the opposite spinning side too. It was easy to introduce to him, and easy to clean too!",249
250,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,This product sucks. My little boy LOVES to chew on things while he's teething - and he bites down hard. He was never able to bite hard enough to get this dumb thing to vibrate. Very disappointing.,250
251,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"The yellow part vibrates once little gums/teeth chomp down on it. easy to hold on to, can easily hook (Via rings or carabiner) to a diaper bag etc. Both my kids loved it while teething.",251
252,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,My son is 4 months old and can not quite get a hang of other teethers. Some of them you have to bend in a specific direction to make the vibration happen. This teether is great. They just bite down (naturally) and the vibration helps with the comfort. I love it!,252
253,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,This arrived the next day after I bought it and I was very grateful!  We had one other one that my son managed to lose and he was miserable without it!  It really helped soothe his mouth while he was teething!,253
254,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I have two of these teethers and both see variable use as my little guy goes through teething spurts.In between, he actually likes sitting or kneeling on the star to get it to vibrate.But as soon as his gums start hurting, he goes straight for this toy.Also, it's a smart packaging extra to have the 'free ring' on top which clearly doubles for hanging purposes.",254
255,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My son is obsessed with this teether!! He was first more fascinated with spinning the bottom part and chewing on that but after 4 months of having it, he has now switched and loves the rubber/vibrating part. I don't know what I would do without this one, I think it is a must have! Not only a teether but a toy as well :)",255
256,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I bought this for upcoming teething, and we still don't seem to be there, but my baby just thinks this thing is good fun.  She bites on it and the vibration cracks her up.  That's enough for me!",256
257,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,My LO is definitely teething and I've tried giving this to her but she can never get the massager to go at it on her own.  I will have to put it in her mouth and press it at the same time.  She looks at me and I imagine her thinking &#34;what the heck is that&#34; and she pulls her face away.  I'm hoping she'll want to use it again before her teeth actually come in since I can't return it at this point.  We're sticking to the fake keys and her little Sophie the Giraffe for now.,257
258,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"Bought this based on the reviews. My daughter is an early teether at 3 months old. My only complaint is that she has a hard time activating the vibration by biting hard enough. This has allot to do with her age. I have to hold one of the corners for her to activate the vibration. She LOVES it, I only wish it had an on/off switch so I didn't have to hold it for her. She actually cries when I try to take it away from her.",258
259,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,My baby loves the vibrations on his teeth. He also shakes it like a rattle. This product is good quality.,259
260,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,I've bought several teethers and this i one of the best ones. The vibration helps ease the discomfort and the colors make it also very interesting.,260
261,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I know it's a safety feature, but it is unfortunate that the batteries are not replaceable in this, because I will probably have to buy another one of these soon, because my little one LOVES this.  He seemed to hate all other teething options out there...even Sophie he had to learn to love (he's does like it now), but this he gnaws away on vigorously.The star shaped chewing part is a little big and that worried me a bit when I first got it, but it actually hasn't seemed to bother him that much.  So far (he got this at 5 months) he can't always make the vibration happen himself but, 1)It's not that difficult for me to just push down on it as I'm holding it for him since I like how it calms him down and 2) even when it doesn't vibrate, he still loves to chew away at it.  He has learned over time a bit better about how hard to bite down to make it go too and that it will go by chewing on any of the three available &#34;tips&#34; to the star.He also really likes the little spinning rattle on the end and it has little nibs that he likes to chomp on too (even though it is hard plastic and the star is rubber like).  It is a &#34;substantial&#34;  toy though, so if your little one is in the phase of swinging toys around really hard, they may bonk themselves now and again, but our son seemed relatively un-phased by that.",261
262,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,I got this for my son when he was about 8 months. he loved bitting it and he carry it all over the house. He is now 18 months and it still works plus he still bits on it too. I found it very easy to clean too.,262
263,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"This thing is big. Baby can grow into it. It really does help when I hold it and turn it on for him. If he isn't done with it he is sure to let me know. Which to me translates that he likes it. I'm not sure how I feel about the sticky feeling plastic, seems unnecessary and everything sticks to it.",263
264,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"If I can recommend one teether to buy for your teething baby, it would be this one. The vibration made it fun and it took the edge off for my little guy. The shape/handle made it really easy for him to hold. We never leave the house without this thing and it is the go-to gift I give to all my expecting friends.",264
265,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"Baby loves this teether. Nice to have something different from all of the other teethers out there. The nice thing is that when she no longer wants it to vibrate, she still has fun the with handle the spins. Great product and it has lasted despite being thrown all around.",265
266,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I had bought a similar toy like this in the 90's for my daughter when she was teething and now she has children. I bought one for my grandson, then more recently this one for my granddaughter. Babies love the sensation it gives them when their front teeth are coming out and making them miserable. I believe it relieves them of some of their pain and I highly recommend any parent with teething babies to get this toy for them! It is a sturdy product and you don't have to worry about any little parts coming loose or damaged. My babies and grandkids abused theirs and it still took the beating.",266
267,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"We have another vibrating teether that is very similar to this one, there are some differences though.This one is much softer on the outside which could be nice on tender gums.This one has 3 points that she can use to pin point the problem area.Each point has a different texture (bumps, ridges) so there is some varianceThis one seems like it is easier to activateI will say that I don't know if she favors one for the other.  It seems like she uses them both about equally.She also likes to play with it by making it vibrate on her hands, feet, cheeks etc.  We have had a lot of fun playing with it.It's a great find and I wish I had come across it sooner.",267
268,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"This is great, my son loves it and it's pretty easy for him to hold he enjoys the vibrations when he chews on it.",268
269,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,A favorite in our house!,269
270,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I had this very teether for my twin boys 8 years ago and they absolutely loved it.  So, when my new baby started teething, I sought out the same teether.  I was surprised when it arrived and the packaging stated that the product is, ""safety tested"" for BPA, lead, and phthalates.  It does not state ANYWHERE on the package that it is BPA free.  As a former regulator (of medical devices) I am very sensitive about company labeling and statements.  Perhaps too much so.  But, I would rather err on the side of caution where my child is concerned, and the lack of clear ""BPA free"" labeling on this product gives me pause.  Specifically, when they test it for BPA, lead, and phthalates, is there an acceptable amount allowed?!  If not, why wouldn't the company simply label the product as BPA, lead, and phthalate free?Eight years ago, when I gave this toy to my sons, no one had ever heard of BPA.  My boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths, and I'm sure it was all riddled with BPA.  But, in this day and age, when BPA is strongly suspected of being dangerous, I cannot in good conscience allow my new baby to chew on anything that MAY contain it.  And, though someone on this site indicated that a representative from the company TOLD them it was BPA free, I'm still skeptical.  Again, why not label it as such?  Most companies proudly label their products with that simple language that cannot be confused.",270
271,The First Years Soft Teething Beads,"My son has had this teether since he was 3 months old. I thought maybe he's just too young & not interested in it(even though he did have 2 teeth already) He is now 8 months old, and still isn't very interested in this teether. The reason I bought it was because it was in-expensive and easy for him to hold & pick up. He would rather pick up a toy car, or some sort of stuffed toy, which I understand every child is different. My only big complaint - the star bead on the end. It is hard, and pointy. If it catches my son's sore, in-coming teeth the wrong way, he will cry. Other then that, the colors are great, and definitely catch baby's eye. Overall, it's an OK toy for the price.",271
272,The First Years Soft Teething Beads,"This teething ring is great!  We probably have enough toys to have our own toy store, including at least 2-3 of these teething rings! Our 10-mth-old baby loves to stick one of them in his mouth (like just one bead of it) and walk or crawl around with his hands free to hold other toys.  Our 7-mth-old, loves it too, with his favorite game being to simply have one of us sit it on his head and then wait for it to fall off when he moves.  He thinks it is hestarical.  It's amazing how much fun they can have with such a simple toy.",272
273,The First Years Soft Teething Beads,My daughter loves this and it keeps her happy for a long time.  It is also very easy to wash to keep clean as well.,273
274,The First Years Soft Teething Beads,"My baby loves to play with this during bath time! It's easy for her to hold, bite and play with!",274
275,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I bought this for my 8 week old daughter, we are planning a trip to Texas and did not want to take the heavy stroller...I tried her in the sling,she got very hot and because of that she got heat rash all over her face and neck (she was only in the sling for about 10 minutes)!!!! I did not like all the padding, it makes it to bulky! On top of all that it gave me a back ache!!If you are serious about a sling I would choose the Maya, it is a thinner material, and is not bulky at all. That is what I ended up buying, and my daughter loves it and so do I.",275
276,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I thought this would be an excellent item to have. I was wrong! This is the most cumbersome thing I own and my son sweats like crazy in it. There's no support for the baby's neck or back, and I always feel like he's about to fall out of it. Unless you've got really strong shoulders or a feather-weight infant, you might want to skip the infant carrier thing completely. Save yourself time and money on this - I wouldn't buy it again!!",276
277,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"It is a little awkward at first, but I had an extremely premature baby who was too small for the traditional carriers, and needed to be held all the time.  I lived, cooked, did laundry, ate, and slept with this sling for 2 months.  Once my baby was bigger and needed to be held less I started using other carriers.  But now I'm back to the sling because quite frankly, once you get the hang of it, its much, much easier to get baby in and out of it.",277
278,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I think the idea behind the sling is great but it is not for every baby.  Everytime our son is put in this he crys or screams.  He is an easy going fellow but he hasn't liked being held to closely.  He wants his freedom and this doesn't give much freedom to a newborn.  Also, the &quot;training&quot; video is more of a promotional advertisement.  I had to go to the web site to get more information about how to use it.",278
279,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,This is a great product but it is just too big for me. If you are 5'5&quot; inch. and below please do not get this cause it will look like a sack on you.  My baby was terrified and looked uncomfortable in it. She cried everytime I put her inside. Practice makes perfect but eventually my baby &amp; I got tired of using this.,279
280,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"After reading all the great reviews on the sling I decided to try one.  We both hated it. Maybe because I'm 5'1 and my son was eleven pounds when he was born made it more difficult. I kept trying to make it work for us but after 6 months I gave it up. I ended up giving it away. It's not one size fits all. If you're short, think twice on this.",280
281,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I used this sling for both of my babies, (0-&gt; 2.5yrs). We had a front backpack style which was good for about 3 months, until the weight of the baby started to make my back ache.The best thing about this sling, besides the fact that the kids loved riding in it, is that it folds up into a reasonably size bundle that fit in my diaper bag. So as the kids aged, and wanted to walk on their own I could just toss this carrier in the diaper bag for when they got tired. Also with the kid riding either in front or on your hip, they are very accessible, so that you can hand them something, like a bottle or a bit of food when you are on the go. (Say like walking around at the Zoo.)I must admit I liked the hip carry position best, it mimic's having my arm under their butt, and holds them close.Anyway its reasonably priced, you'll get your use out of it, (unlike the front only carriers, which as I mentioned aren't good for very long, or the backpack carriers, which while are good for that heavy load, don't pack up and so aren't with you when you need them.)",281
282,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,My Grandson is super fussy and I used this for my own son. Put my Grandson in this turned on the vacuum and he was out like a light! He looked just like he was back in the womb!Thank goodness I still had this as it is no longer available. What a great product!,282
283,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"Every time I hear a parent say that they tried a sling, but baby hated it, or it was a pain, or they just ended up not using it, this was the sling they tried.  People who love their slings used a Maya Wrap, Over the Shoulder Baby Holder, or New Native sling.  All of which come in great fabric choices and are easy to use.",283
284,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I am the the mother of a 14 week old who has reflux and is uncomfortable sleeping in a crib or anywhere flat. She wants to be held *all* the time, and it was getting pretty exhausting in our arms (and my chronic tendonitis was flaring up) until we ordered the sling after reading about it in Dr. Sears's The Baby Book.  I had my doubts, but boy has it been a lifesaver!The sling has been invaluable for me, my husband, and our regular sitter. With it, we are able to walk, bounce, give the calming pinky finger treatment, and see what's going on with the baby. She started using the sling at 2 weeks, when she was about 7 pounds. It took a few times, but she is now completely comfortable in it and it is a favorite napping spot.As I am large-breasted, I did find it awkward to breastfeed in it, although I've been able to do it successfully a couple of times in public sitting down.  The fabric is soft and easily washable (important for those baby mishaps).  The padding helps me feel comfortable as a bit of protection in case of bumping.  The size is very adjustable for different height people, although you may need to pull through a lot of fabric to bring small babies in tightly, especially if you have a smaller chest size.The NoJo sling would benefit from having some loose fabric at the end to cover the baby's head in the sun and provide more coverage during breastfeeding. The stopper piece of plastic at the end of the fabric adds safety (it won't pull through), however it can whack the baby if you aren't careful when getting it on or off.  It could also use a zippered storage area, a feature of some other slings.  Also, the blue with plaid seems to be the only fabric sold these days, although I have seen other patterns and colors on eBay.  This is fine with jeans, but not great when you have to go to a wedding, as I did with the sling earlier this summer. I think it also makes people think that she's a boy, for some reason.  Maybe it's the blue and the fact that they can't see her cute dresses!The sling is also helpful in keeping interested strangers at a slight distance away from the baby -- they are less able to grab at her, which I think is good from a germ perspective, especially for newborns. When it is very hot or humid out, this sling can be a bit heavy for the baby (especially up against a hot mama!), but on cooler days the fabric adds just the right amount of warmth, like a light blanket.When I was pregnant, I assumed the Baby Bjorn would be all we would need. Instead it hangs on a hook most of the time unless we're going for a long walk or shopping -- activities where having two hands is important and you'll be doing them for a while. That thing is so hard to get on and off! Plus, you aren't supposed to use it until they are 8 lbs. The baby seems to really like the flexibility of positioning with the sling -- especially curling up happily in a womb-like ball -- and sometimes gets irritated by being all dangled out in the Bjorn.Carrying the baby in the sling makes you so much more mobile than using a stroller or lugging her around in her heavy carseat, so I use it whenever I anticipate being in public where they are stairs, space issues, or other impediments.  It's good for short shopping trips as well, especially if you're with a friend who can carry things or push a cart, both of which are harder to do with the sling on.She's also a million times more comfortable in the sling than in her car seat, where she often cries.  Our NoJo Babysling has been in constant use since it arrived, and ties the bouncy seat (where she mostly sleeps by day) as the best return on investment of any of the baby gizmos we bought.  Our sitter will often wear the baby for her entire nap. The sitter just sits (often in a rocking chair or porch swing to provide some more movement) and reads while the baby sleeps.One last thing that's great is that when the baby falls asleep, she can be laid down on the bed or bouncy chair and the sling just slips off the wearer without waking the baby.I did not watch the video, but did read the sling chapter in the Baby Book, which was helpful. We have recently started using the kangaroo (facing out) position as the baby loves looking at the outside world now. It's nice to have this sort of flexibility.  If you are getting tired carrying around your baby, and would like an extra hand free, a sling is a great investment and while not the most elegant, the NoJo is a good workhorse one to use on a daily basis.",284
285,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I love Dr. Sear's books, but this baby sling is much too large!  I am a slightly small framed 5'5"" woman.  My 6'5"" husband wears this sling just fine.  But, for a sling to work for YOU, it MUST FIT properly!  I finally bought a sling that fit me when my son was over 1 year old.  I couldn't believe what a difference it made and felt so sad that I hadn't tried a different sling sooner. My son loves sitting in it on my hip and brings it to me whenever I am working in the kitchen. Try the Rosado sling or any other brand that comes in sizes and buy the size that fits your body!  You will really be able to enjoy the baby wearing experience that Dr. Sears recommends so highly!",285
286,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I think slings are some of the most useful items for babies. They make nursing so easy, even while walking around on the street or in a busy store. I love the Sears Library, so I thought the Sears NoJo sling would be great. While I did use it for a long time, and would still recommend it over a front or back carrier (at least for the first few months), I found that this sling was difficult to adjust and my baby seemed to disappear in the first month or so. For small babies I prefer a sling with no railings, and more adjustable. The New Native sling and many others offer this. I would shop around online, there are many better slings than this.",286
287,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"We purchased the Babysling when our daughter was 2 weeks old.  I was looking for a baby carrier that I could wear while nursing her that would be comfortable and discreet.  Initially, I found the sling very awkward to use.  I wasn't able to master nursing her in the sling until she was 2-3 months old.  However, as a carrier the babysling was great from the beginning.  Our daughter was colicy, and being able to put her in the sling all cozied up to either myself or my husband, hands free, was a God send.  This calmed her 90% of the time.  As the months went by, being able to wear her in the sling enabled me to get housework done without baby crying to be picked up - she was already up, and was able to be &quot;involved&quot; in my daily activities this way.There are many different ways to wear your baby in the sling, and that versatility has made it one of the best baby product purchases we made.  Our daughter is now 2 1/2 (30+ lbs.), and when she's having a rough &quot;toddler day&quot; will still occasionally ask for the sling.Be patient with the sling.  Practice with it, and if you can, find a friend who has used one successfully.  Dr. Sears also has a whole chapter on using a sling (any sling, not just this brand) in his book The Baby Book - great photos in there to help get the hang of things.One last remark... I have a friend who tried this sling and was unable to get it tight around her body (she's very petite).  There are other brands of slings (Maya Wrap, Over the Shoulder Baby Holder) that come in multiple sizes that might allow for a more customized fit.",287
288,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"This sling is the third baby carrier I purchased, when the first two highly-promoted products were too uncomfortable.  My son was a premature baby who needed to be carried a lot for the first few months.  After we purchased this sling, my son basically lived in it!  The variety of cozy positions were perfect for his needs, and the sling fits so comfortably on both my husband and me that we don't even feel the weight of the baby when he's in it.  In fact, the weight of the baby is so evenly distributed that you don't develop the shoulder strain or lower back sway that other products gave us.  We would recommend this sling to anyone with a newborn or premature baby, and we continue to use it now that our son is a big 6-month old baby.  Buy it!",288
289,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I got a regular carrier as a gift and I hated it! The baby would slide down in it, even though it says its for newborns. I have two other children and had to attend open house at two different schools. The first open house I had the baby in the carrier and it was awful. I ended up taking the baby out of it. My breastfeeding consultant told me about the sling an I went out and brought it right away. It is the best thing I could have ever got for myself and baby. The second open house was so much easier. The baby just bald up like in my womb and slept for the whole two hours. It was also great because I had both hands free to meet and greet the teachers. It comes in handy for breastfeeding discretly in public which for some moms is a must. The baby would sometimes get upset when taken out of the sling. I would recommend the sling to every mom every where!!!!!!",289
290,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"My neighbor had the Nojo and liked it so I was going to get one too. I tried hers, but I couldn't get it tight enough so my baby hung down too low which didn't seem safe and hurt my back. I thought I could order a different size, but found it only comes in one size. I then read all the reviews here and followed someone's advice and ordered a from babymoon slings. It fit me better (I'm petite) and was a lot easier to use (and prettier!). I think it makes a big difference to get a sling that's not bulky and comes in sizes - I don't get why they use so much padding in the nojo, it makes it really hard to use with a newborn compared to other slings.",290
291,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I have four children and have seen the benefits of the sling first-hand in varied situations.  My first was very small, and as a newborn, I thought he seemed lost in the sling so I exchanged it for a front-pack carrier.  Now I know that you can put a blanket or such in the sling to help cradle a newborn more securely.  It was a lost opportunity for us.  With the arrival of my second child, I decided to give it another try, as many of my friends raved about theirs and I'd need my hands free for my first child still.  I found the sling to be great for nursing, and afforded me privacy when I had to do so while out and about as I could pull the sling's fabric right over the baby and cover us both.  For a tired baby, it is much more conducive to sleeping than an upright carrier, and you can slip out of it and lay the baby down while still in the sling, if necessary.  My third child was (and still is) very cuddly, and enjoyed being next to me.  Since a mom's arms tire after a while, I found the sling a great way to incorporate baby into my routine without wearing myself out.  My fourth child turned our world upside-down with a very colicky start.  The &quot;insert-in-sling-and-go&quot; method was the only way to settle him down.  I could nurse, cook supper, do whatever I needed to do while keeping him close and moving, which was the key.  He learned to relax and even sleep while I was doing all sorts of things and making quite a racket at times.  Now at nearly three, he'll fall asleep while I'm driving and I can take him into the house, remove his coat and shoes, then carry him upstairs to bed without disturbing him.  I believe his learning to relax and sleep in the sling with so much going on around him has helped him in this area, too.  Most of all, it is just nice to have that close time with your little one in the sling, even if you are busy with other things to do.  I can't promise miracles, but this sling has been a crucial part of our early parenting and I recommend it highly!",291
292,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I bought this babysling after reading about it in Dr. Sears' book.  My daughter was 2 months old and fussy!  Nothing seemed to work.  I was desperate!  Since the babysling was adjustable I thought it would fit all body types...not!  I am of average height but on the slimmer side.  It gave me alot of shoulder and back pain.  I rate this a one star because I found one use for it...I use it tied around my torso to carry my daughter on my back with the slight support of my hands. Back carrying is a bit tricky so don't try it alone!  I think baby slings are great but not this one is not for me.  If you are slimmer than average, try the New Native baby carrier.  It's portable and comes in different sizes.",292
293,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,I disagree with all of the reviews that say one size does not fit all. My Husbad is 6&quot;4 I am small frame 5&quot;2 and all we had to do when switching was move the adjustment. It was quite easy. We bought this after having the others. But they spread our daughter legs too far and she wanted to lie down at times not sit up. It was great because she could sit or lie down. And when she was very fussy it was the only way to get her to sleep. We then just slipped it off and put her down. IT was Great! Now that she is older I no longer use it but it was such a life saver I could not bring myself to get rid of it.  I not only recomend this but Dr. Sears book to anyone who has a fussy baby.,293
294,"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Original Bassinet, Solid Toffee","I love the idea of the co-sleeper. I've seen some other concept designs by other companies and I hope they follow through with them. Arm's Reach has a bit of a monopoly on the co-sleepers right now. My little one hasn't arrived yet, so I haven't actually used it yet. Assembly is REALLY confusing. I don't know what happened to my paper instructions, but I can't find them. Luckily, there are some on the AR web page. But it is still so confusing.For those of us who are ardent Attachment Parenting, this is ideal. My older son, 15 months old, is still in bed with us and this Arm's Reach will give us the extra space for two little ones. We used the Snuggle Nest when our older boy was a small infant and that worked great. With two though, I wanted to keep the older away from the younger while they slept but still near us.If attachment parenting is a new concept for you, I strongly encourage you to read as much as you can online. Arm's Reach co-sleeper is a great way to co-sleep without the fear of suffocation.",294
295,Arm's Reach Original Co-sleeper 100% Cotton White Sheet,I would recommend getting cheaper sheets made for a playpen. These started unraveling after one wash! Not worth the money.,295
296,Arm's Reach Original Co-sleeper 100% Cotton White Sheet,"This is a must for anyone who is buying the Co-Sleeper, it adds comfort and you can easily clean the surface your little one is sleeping on buy simply switching out he sheets. The Co-Sleeper comes with one, but in the middle of the night it is much easier to switch a sheet than have to wait for the other to finish washing.",296
