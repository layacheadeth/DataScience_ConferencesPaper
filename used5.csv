0,Planetwise Flannel Wipes,"These flannel wipes are OK, but in my opinion not worth keeping.  I also ordered someImse Vimse Cloth Wipes-Ocean Blue-12 countwhich are larger, had a nicer, softer texture and just seemed higher quality.  I use cloth wipes for hands and faces and have been usingThirsties 6 Pack Fab Wipes, Boyfor about 8 months now and need to replace them because they are starting to get rough and have had stink issues for a while that stripping no longer handles.",0,Baby_Care

3,Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book,"This is a product well worth the purchase.  I have not found anything else like this, and it is a positive, ingenious approach to losing the binky.  What I love most about this product is how much ownership my daughter has in getting rid of the binky.  She is so proud of herself, and loves her little fairy.  I love the artwork, the chart in the back, and the clever approach of this tool.",3,Baby_Care
4,Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book,"All of my kids have cried non-stop when I tried to ween them off their pacifier, until I found Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet.  It is an easy way to work with your kids to allow them to understand where their pacifier is going and help them part from it.This is a must buy book, and a great gift for expecting parents!!  You will save them soo many headaches.Thanks for this book!  You all rock!!",4,Baby_Care
5,Stop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book,"When the Binky Fairy came to our house, we didn't have any special gift and book to help explain to her about how important it is to stop using a pacifier. This book does a great job to help prepare your child for the loss of their favorite item. The doll is adorable and we made lots of cute movies with the Binky Fairy telling our daughter about what happens when the Binky Fairy comes. I would highly recommend this product for any parent trying to break the pacifier or thumb sucking habit.",5,Baby_Care
6,A Tale of Baby's Days with Peter Rabbit,"Lovely book, it's bound tightly so you may not be able to add alot of photos/cards aside from the designated spaces in the book. Shop around before you purchase, as it is currently listed at Barnes & Noble for 29.95!",6,Nursery
7,"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","Perfect for new parents. We were able to keep track of baby's feeding, sleep and diaper change schedule for the first two and a half months of her life. Made life easier when the doctor would ask questions about habits because we had it all right there!",7,Gift
8,"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","A friend of mine pinned this product on Pinterest so I decided to give it a whirl! It is fantastic! If you are a new parent, this will help you keep track of feedings, diaper changes and the like!",8,Gift
9,"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log",This has been an easy way for my nanny to record all the key events that happen with my baby when I'm not at home.  Would highly recommend it to someone who wants to stay informed of what your baby is up to while you're not home.The only reason this isn't a 5 is because I think there could have been some more standarad pre-printed options.I plan on ordering another one when we run out of pages in this journal.,9,Gift
10,"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I love this journal and our nanny uses it everyday to track on our daughter's sleep, eating and other activities. The layout and design make it very easy to fill in quickly with a comments column to add in details (i.e. we ask the nanny to specify what food she had for lunch, amount of milk she took, specifics of play time--tummy time, walk to park, etc.) I love knowing the details of my baby's day, and I also use it to track weekly on overall schedule patterns and changes (i.e. baby's nap time has moved naturally as she gets older).My only complaint is that there is no real space to communicate back to the nanny, as I sometimes want to reply to the nanny's comments and/or leave her notes about the previous night (i.e. Baby didn't sleep well or baby has rash, etc) or other instructions (Please use sun screen on the baby - it's hot out today) that I often forget to tell her in the rush of the morning. I just stick in post-its now for my notes. All in all, I highly recommend this baby tracker.",10,Gift
11,"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","This book is perfect!  I'm a first time new mom, and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, sleep.  Definitely would recommend this for new moms.  Plus it's small enough that I throw in the diaper back for doctor visits.",11,Gift
12,"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I originally just gave the nanny a pad of paper to write down this information for my little one. She would take him to the park and leave the pad behind - I was getting incomplete/inaccurate information when she wohld get home at the end of the day and try to remember naps/feedings/diaper changes. I wanted something she could take with her and also a way to better control how she reported information. This was the perfect solution! Now I'm getting all the information I wanted. There is a very helpful example of how to fill it out. It also has a pouch for additional documents and a section up front for emergency contact info. Each page goes from 7 - 6. This works for me because the nanny starts at 7am and ends before 6pm. I use an app on my phone for tracking when I'm with the baby. I transfer the info from this notebook to my phone. My only complaint: the space is pretty small - they provide useful shorthand, but it's a little difficult to fit some of the info in the space provided. Also, some of the other reviews complain about the 7 - 6 time format. This isn't a real problem for me, but I suppose if you wanted to track an entire day, you would have to use two pages - not too big of a deal. 7am - 6pm is pretty much perfect for daycare/nanny/caregiver situation.",12,Gift
13,"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I thought keeping a simple handwritten journal would be nice.  But I haven't used this thing at all, and here's why:1.) When you're breastfeeding, it's often nice to have your phone close by so that you can keep yourself entertained.  If you are able to grab *both* your phone and this notebook - and a pen - consistently - and at 3 in the morning - you are more skilled than me.  (I don't nurse in the same place every time.)2.) You're also often so sleep deprived that - at least for me - I'd forget to look at what time we started on a side, or what side we started on.  I'm not perfect with the app I have either, but at least I just have to mindlessly hit a button.3.) I really like the app I have (Baby Connect).  It gives me better data.  For example, it can tell me how long on average feedings have been taking (helpful as we start to think about sleep training).  It can tell me that I nursed him 177 times last month (granted that serves no useful purpose other than a feeling of perverse satisfaction).",13,Gift

15,Nature's Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar,"I bought this calender for myself for my second son. It is very colorful and has room on each page to write height, weight, and what baby likes to do. There is also room on each page for a photo to be placed. The calender date boxes have room for a sticker and some fine writing. My only complaint is that it does not have as many stickers as I would like, but I just put asterisks before whatever special event happened that day. I bought one for a friend as she found it very useful as well.",15,Baby_stationary
16,Nature's Lullabies First Year Sticker Calendar,"I love this little calender, you can keep track of all of baby's firsts. I like the illustrations, and the stickers too.",16,Baby_stationary
17,Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,This was the only calender I could find for the second year. I did one for the first and wanted to continue cause there are so many things to note still after they turn 1. This one was better than the first year one I got him.,17,Baby_stationary
18,Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,I completed a calendar for my son's first year and really enjoyed tracking all of his milestones and special moments - so much so that I wanted to continue in the second year since he's still doing amazing and fun things every day.  I really like the simple layout of the calendar and while it might not have all the questions and milestone stickers you want - at least it's something to keep recording all those special moments!,18,Baby_stationary
19,Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,We wanted to get something to keep track of our child's milestones and this is a cute option. There aren't many other choices out there and this does exactly what we wanted.,19,Baby_stationary
20,Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"I had a hard time finding a second year calendar, this is the only one I came across and it is great!  Large enough to write in the squares and has a spot to put that month's picture in as well as some memories. The first two years they change so much I like to jot everything down so I can keep track of all the big milestones...and little ones!  I find it is easier to do this on a calendar vs a baby book.  This way you can fill out the baby book later and have a great reference to do so!",20,Baby_stationary
21,Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"I only purchased a second-year calendar for my son because I had one for my daughter. I was really disappointed with the lack of selection available for second-year calendars in general, so I just got this one because it was one of the only ones. It's an okay calendar. The finish on the pages is glossy which makes it hard to write on with certain pens. The stickers aren't very cute and the pages are pretty old-fashioned looking. Hopefully they will come out with some other calendars for future purchasers.",21,Baby_stationary
22,Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,I LOVE this calendar for recording events of my son's second year of life.  There are plenty of 1st year baby calendars out there and I loved reocording events of his first year and didn't want to just stop now that he is one.  Nature's lullabies second year calendar is perfect for continuing on with daily record keeping.  The stickers are wonderful and helped me think of milestones to record that I might not have thought of on my own.  I highly recommend this calendar!  Plus it's super cute and brat for either gender.,22,Baby_stationary
23,Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"Calendar is exactly as described, but I find the look of it to be very cheap.  There are lots of nice stickers to use.  I was just disappointed it looks so cheap.",23,Baby_stationary
24,Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"Wife loves this calender. Comes with a lot of stickers and options to mark the firsts. Includes spaces for milestone photos as well. Sticker borders for photos, etc, it is just a very easy to use scrap booking option. Especially for new moms who dont have enough time to actually sit down, and haul out a ton of scrapbook supplies",24,Baby_stationary
25,Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,My daughter had her 1st baby over a year ago. She did receive and fill up a First Year Calendar. When her son was nearing his first birthday she was looking for a Second Year Calendar to record his milestones. Thanks to Amazon I was able to get this for her and she LOVES it. Tender sweet art work - helpful stickers - unique pages to fill. A nice keepsake. A wonderful gift for a one-year old!,25,Baby_stationary

27,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",My son loves peek a boo at this age of 9 months so I thought this book would be perfect! This book doesn't engage him enough though it seems.  He does however like the cover the most if I make pretend blow-kisses and peekaboo gestures with the hands and show him. He also likes when I fan the hair towards his face.Maybe when he's older he will flip the flaps but right now he just likes the mirror at the end and the front cover. If I flip the book through he just takes the book and shakes it around.,27,Activity_entertainment
28,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","One of baby's first and favorite books, and it is washable! I gave 1 less star than perfect because I'd like to see some diversity in the people - not just your typical white family ;)",28,Activity_entertainment
29,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",I like how the book has a hook to attach it to your stroller or car seat - it wont get lost.  Great way to go over family members.,29,Activity_entertainment
30,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",Beautiful little book.  A great little short story saying I Love You....Keeps the attention of the baby and then the baby can actually turn the pages and hold on to it when you are finished interacting with it.,30,Activity_entertainment
31,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",This book is so worth the money. It says 9+ months on the box but I can't wait for my baby to be born to try to use it before. It's so cute and very interactive! There are flaps to open on every page.,31,Activity_entertainment
32,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","we just got this book for our one-year-old and she loves it.  It's so nice that she can't bite chunks out of it like she can a board book or rip it like a paper one.  She can chew on it, pull on it, and carry it all over the house!  She loves the little flaps that open and is learning simple words like ""daddy,"" ""mommy,"" ""puppy,"" etc.  We love it.",32,Activity_entertainment
33,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",The book is colorful and is perfect for 6months and older. The only thing I didn't like was the strong smell of the dyes and/or material. I dunked the pages in detergent. Then let the book dry overnight.,33,Activity_entertainment
34,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","The book is cute, and we are huge fans of Lamaze products, however, this one leaves out some family members (no little brother) and can possibly cause hurt feelings. That said, our baby loves to play with the hands, hair and flaps!",34,Activity_entertainment
35,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You",What a great book for babies!  I'd been looking for books which couldn't be damaged by my 10-month old's drool...so cloth or plastic books were my options.  This book adds another level to your usual cloth book--a fun flap or moving part on every page.  This interactive book is perfect for my baby!,35,Activity_entertainment
36,"Lamaze Peekaboo, I Love You","My son loved this book as an infant.  It was perfect because he would chew on his board books and destroy them, but this one we didn't have that issue.  I love the Lamaze series, they are a lot of fun not only for the child but for the parent.I liked that this book was not only teaching my son about Peek a Boo, but we used it to learn names for family members like grandparents, sister, cat, dog etc.  And of course with it being a lift the flap book, that was additional fun for my son as well.  He's nearly two now and he doesn't look at it as much, but he still does enjoy reading it and playing with it now and again.  I'd say out of all the Lamaze books, this one and Discovery Farm are his favorites.",36,Activity_entertainment

41,"SoftPlay Giggle Jiggle Funbook, Happy Bear","This bear is absolutely adorable and I would give it a 5 star rating if it actually giggled or growled like it was suppose to!  I just got it in the mail the other day and was super excited when I saw how cute it was!  If it's something as simple as a dead battery I could handle it BUT I can't even find a place where the batteries would to!  Such a disappointment....it's going back and I have no gift to take down to my new Granddaughter, Kenzie, now!",41,Baby_stationary
42,SoftPlay Peek-A-Boo Where's Elmo A Children's Book,"My baby absolutely loves Elmo and so this book seemed perfect for her.  I'm happy to say I was right:  this book is nice and soft and beautifully illustrated so my little one takes it everywhere and ""reads"" it all of the time. While Elmo is the main character of because he hides on each page, other Sesame Street characters are also featured which is fun, too. Another great, interactive, Elmo centric book that I would recommend for the Sesame Street/Elmo lovers is ""Twinkle, Twinkle Elmo"" (which is also available on Amazon for a great price).",42,Baby_stationary

When they use the Elmo book, the kiss Elmo.  Got when they were 9 mos, now they are two and we are still having fun with them.  They love to see how high they can stack the blocks before it falls over.  I buy as a baby present.",48,Baby_stationary
49,"SoftPlay 4 Pack Block Book, Sweet Sesame","I have teething babies and these were great for entertaining the, and letting them chew and droll all over the, without worrying about ruining them. They were great for setting them off to their side to encourage rolling over and crawling. Great Christmas gift for the younger baby and didn't break the bank.",49,Baby_stationary

51,SoftPlay Baby's First Cloth Books Gift Set,"It is so hard to find cloth books with ACTUAL images on them! So many have unrealistic portrayals of what animals/objects look like, but this one is fantastic.

Also has spots for personalization and pictures.,56,Baby_stationary
57,Baby's First Year Undated Wall Calendar with Stickers to Mark &quot;Firsts&quot; - Pink,This is a very good gift for a new mother.  You would want to give it to the parents as soon as baby is born so that they can start from the very beginning to chart the &#34;firsts&#34;.

65,My Kindergarten Year - A Keepsake Book,"I was pleasantly surprised upon receiving the memory book entitled,  ""My Kindergarten Year"".

77,Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),We bought the pins as my 6 year old Autistic son was able to open or break open normal safety pins we needed to use for his night time clothes.  These new pins are significantly more sturdy and he hasn't learned how to open them and only once has he broken one open.  I seem to recall that their shipping price was more than a bit on the high side of reasonable though given the size of the package...,77,Diapering

82,Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"It has been many years since we needed diaper pins, but I do like to pin my socks together through the wash and have never lost one yet. I was using brass dressmaker pins but they tended to open up during the wash cycle. My wife suggested diaper pins and we tried them. Thery're working perfectly and staying together through the washing. Matter of fact they can get a little tricky to open, but of course that was the idea. Recommended to keep your socks &#34;friended up&#34;.",82,Diapering
83,Cloth Diaper Pins Stainless Steel Traditional Safety Pin (Black),"As another reviewer noted, these are great for matching socks before washing.  Now once the socks come out of the washer, I hang them to dry with the pins still on.  The socks stay on the line to dry without clothespins, they just hang with one sock on each side of the line.  After they are dried, I just open the pin and leave it by the hamper on a shelf.  As I put dirty socks into the hamper, I grab a pin and use it.  Has saved a lot of time and I don't have the problem of lost socks or mismatched socks on my feet.  Great idea and am glad I read about this here on the reviews.  Wish I had done this my whole life.",83,Diapering

89,Wall-stickers Wall Decor Removable Decal Sticker - Giant Cherry Blossom Tree in Wind,I am pleased with the design I just wish the actual picture was bigger an putting it together doesn't make sense the numbers aligned with the branches don't make any sense compared to the picture they give you as an instruction -- you have to sort of free hand. I had to start it half way up my wall so it made a difference an could actually be seen -- as far as it hold up I put it up about 2 weeks ago an it had not peeled off at all.,89,Nursery

91,New Style Trailing Cherry Blossom Tree Decal Removable Vinyl Kids Wall Decal Wall Sticker Peel and Stick,Was so excited to get this product for my baby girls bedroom!  When I got it the back is NOT STICKY at all!  Every time I walked into the bedroom I was picking up pieces off of the floor!  Very very frustrating!

92,Blessed By Pope Francis Franciscan Knotted Our Lady of Grace Italian Made Aurora Borealis Crystal Rosary,"I ordered this Rosary for a friend because it looked lovely in the photo and it is blessed by Pope Francis.  I was not disappointed as it is just beautiful, made with crystal, and knotted in between the Our Fathers.  I am giving this to my friend along with a copy of the novena of Our Lady Untier (or Undoer) of Knots, for whom Pope Francis has a strong devotion.  I definitely recommend this Rosary and would buy it again in a heart beat.",92,Nursery

94,Musical Christmas Nativity Scene Angel with Baby Jesus in a Rustic Barkwood Resin Manger 8&quot; Tall,I was so excited to get this nativity.  I have been watching it for months and I finally had an excuse to spend $25.00.  It is beautiful and I am very happy with the look of the item.  I am not so happy about the music box.  The song is WAY too fast and it had to play it through once to even recognize the song.  I don't know if there is a way to slow down a music box; if there is I wish someone would tell me.  I still love the nativity but I am not as excited as I would be if the music had been right.Buyer beware... beautiful nativity; not so great music,94,Nursery

I love the bangles however they are a bit small. Had to slid them on with lotion. I like a snug fitting bangle but whew these were tough to get on!! If my hand was a hair bigger they wouldn't have fit. They are on to stay. I have small hands also. I got the size for large kid small adult and they fit wrist but tough over the hand.

103,"Newborn Baby Tracker&reg; - Round the Clock Childcare Journal, Log Book","Of course this has been a great/easy way for me to record all of my baby's routines and a simple way for his caregiver to let me know how the day went.  What I really love about it, though, is that it was so easy for me to jot down all of his major milestones as they happened.  I knew that I wouldn't have time to work on his baby book in the beginning (and sure enough I didn't even get it out until after 2 months), and because I had this book I was able to finally transfer everything over.

I like having the room to write things about our baby's day and development, plus use the ""Notes"" section to write some story, etc.  It also helps ""Dad"" see what has happened that day and feels more connected.

This tracker though, is laid out very well and keeps things pretty organized.  My only complaint is that it is not a full year tracker - I did the whole first year with my first son which is nice to refer back to.  I would recommend this book, but if you're interested in tracking the whole first year you will need to buy 3 (they run 4 months long).",111,Gift

Sleep deprivation can compromise anyones ability to recall feeding and napping times, which breast was last used, soiled diapers, etc.. I even sleep with my journal to keep it close by so I can document around the clock.  The layout of this journal is very simple and easy to use at a quick glance.  I understand there are phone apps that do the same thing however, I chose this journal to allow my husband and nanny to have access to the information.  A must have and will make a great gift.",113,Gift

I love the fact that they can be removed from the wall and moved to a room or house if needed.  I would get these instead of wall decals because they are 1. easier to put up and 2. can be moved without ruining them.  It makes his play area look really cool!,115,Baby_toddler_toys

126,Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,My daughter started playing with her Music Blocks set when she was just a few months old.  She spent hours entertaining herself.  She is now 18 months old and still loves this toy.  Now she understands how to arrange the blocks and has great fun making new musical patterns.  I highly recommend the Jumpin' Jive Jazz cartridge -- it's her favorite -- and the Bach cartridge when you want calmer music.,126,Baby_toddler_toys
127,Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"It takes a youthful spirit of inquiry and fascination to play with blocks and pre-programmed music. Anyone too old to play with blocks (or to young to play with them again) may back off. But they're missing a revolution in interactive toys. Each colored block represents part of a musical score, and each side on the block represents one way of delivering that piece, such as horn, violin, or voice. Turning and swapping blocks thus generates changes in the music played, with incredible variety. You (and, oh yes, the child too) will run out of steam long before you run out of interest. And the use of additional block sets expands the use and interest even more. Bravo!!",127,Baby_toddler_toys
128,Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,This was one of my favorite toys-but beware if you buy this I went through 3 of these- and the company no longer exists-so if there is a problem with it-you are out of luck,128,Baby_toddler_toys
129,Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"Our whole family loved the Mozart music blocks. I even bought another &quot;disk&quot; of music. Unfortunately, it was a constant challenge to keep the kids from destroying the delicate &quot;chip&quot; that was easily accessible. Finally it broke and I felt it was too expensive to replace. I feel that a toy at this price should be more durable. My suggestion would be to hide the &quot;plug in chip&quot; so that the kids aren't attracted to it. We have a 3-year old and a one-year old. The toy lasted about 6 months.",129,Baby_toddler_toys
130,Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"This is an interesting and educational toy.  I got it for my 2 year old, and while she loved mixing up the blocks, she also loved pulling out the cartridge and couldn't put it back in.  That means I had to go put the cartridge back every 5 minutes.  If the cartridge were placed on the side or back, I don't think the littler ones would be so inclined to pull it...out of sight out of mind.",130,Baby_toddler_toys
131,Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"Great idea, but the toy IS NOT durable.  After returning one toy for not working, another one has broken.  What a disappointment!!  And the customer service is non-existant and when it is, they are rude!!!! Someone let me know when the class-action lawsuit will occur.",131,Baby_toddler_toys
132,Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,I bought this 18 months ago for my 6 year old and 2 year old.  They both loved it.  I bought additional cartridges then it stopped working.  We replaced the batteries twice and it still does not work.  It was expensive for a toy that did not last very long.,132,Baby_toddler_toys
133,Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,"I spent [a lot of money] when this thing first came out, and it worked TERRIBLY!  I sent it back to the company because it was defective and wouln't shut up.  They sent me another one.  It worked very inconsistently.  When I called the manufacturer I was told ""Well, it's a very sensitve computer, you can't just let them toss it around, that must be why you're having trouble""  Actually, I was having my 2 year sit in his high chair while I supervised him, and he was not doing anything to it.  I mean, it says it's for 2 year olds on the box....  Anyway, I returned it and got my money.  SAve your money for real music lessons.",133,Baby_toddler_toys
134,Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,Recently I have purchased the musical mozart blocks set for my two and a half year old daughter at a toys r us department store near me as a Christmas gift for her this year and they had one of the toys out on display. She loved the toy and it is very educational. I had a hard time leaving the store because she wanted to continue to play with it although she is young enough that even though she was with me while I purchased her toys for Christmas this year that she had completely forgotten about it and that I haought this toy for her. My only complaint is that I had to pay [$$$] for this toy and they had told me that the sale on the toy had ended yesterday but this toy I knew was still available online here for [$$$] which is a really good price and I do not think it is right for them to sell it for the other price when it can be bought cheaper. Anyways I liked the toy alot and my daughter did too and that is why I purchased the toy even at the price I  had to pay for it. I think it will get a lot of use out of it and so will my 8 month old daughter when she is old enough as well.,134,Baby_toddler_toys

Downside: the fish are easy to misplace, so keeping all four together is a challenge.",139,Baby_toddler_toys
140,my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I bought this toy to help stimulate my eight-month-old's development. When I got it in the mail, I immediately opened it and gave it to her. She has been playing with it since. Her favorite is the crinkle crab because she can make him make noise. She is fascinated by the others.

141,my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"Everyone knows nap time can be difficult, my daughter fights it everyday, sometimes she'll even jump around and hit the sides of her crib. We decided putting some of those cribside toys made of hard plastic was unrealistic at this point, however I saw this and got it right away.Although we had tried stuffed animals and other soft toys this works he best. It's a lot more interactive compared with just hugging her teddy bear. Everyday she plays with it, it also occupies her in the morning when she first wakes. I walk into her room and there she is holding her fishy. Plus if she rolls on it during the night there's no chance of hurting herself. She loves it.Great value! Something a little different.",141,Baby_toddler_toys
142,my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,This is a very good toy that helps manual dexterity and the ability to recognize figures behind the clear plastic. My baby girl especially loves the crinkle crab and the clam !,142,Baby_toddler_toys
143,my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,We first bought this toy for our oldest child when she was just beginning to sit up and play with toys.  She would sit in her crib and play for a hour or more just putting the sea creatures in and out.  It gave Mommy shower and make-up time!  We believe she loved the clear plastic on the bowl and the shape and feel of the pieces.  We had the same experience with daughter #2.  We have bought this several times for other new parents.  Our girls have also received similar toys (not Lamaze) ex: a cookie jar and have not enjoyed it anywhere near as much.  A little toy with big entertainment value!,143,Baby_toddler_toys
144,my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I saw this toy before I was pregnant and though it was so cute!So after I had my daughter, I had the best excuse to buy it!!!She loves it.  I bought it for her when she was about 3 months old.  She'd chew on the little clam.  Now she uses it to learn that they make noise, and she can put them in and take them out of the bowl.It's worth the money.  Cute, educational, (quiet.. heh), and durable.",144,Baby_toddler_toys

I don't really think she's old enough to put the individual toys in the fishbowl, but she sure loves playing with them!  I've noticed that she likes &quot;crinkly&quot; toys, so she loves the crab.  So far, it has kept her very entertained.  I really like Lamaze products so far",145,Baby_toddler_toys
146,my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"I bought this toy for my baby and for friends' babies as well. The babies really love the faces on the toys and get a kick out of the different sounds each one makes. They enjoy looking at them through the clear plastic and taking them out and putting them back in over and over. Most kids seem fascinated by ocean creatures anyway, so I think it's bound to be a guaranteed &quot;hit&quot; for any child. My 2 1/2 year old still loves to play with the crab!",146,Baby_toddler_toys

Not the case.My son received this fish bowl when he was about 4 months old.  He is now 9 months.  He chews on the crab for hours, but other than that not much else.  I feel that this is an expensive teething toy.I like the variety of color and the different textures of fabric the toy offers.",147,Baby_toddler_toys

149,Pedal Farm Tractor,"We chose this tractor and trailer for a family gift for our two-year-old son and he loves it!  Visiting friends love it, too.  We looked at several others, but this one seemed to be the safest and most durable.  He cannot pedal the tractor yet, but loves to push it around or be pushed while sitting on it and will soon grow to it (he is tall).  The trailer is a great addition and our son loves to fill it with toys (or his little brother!).  The only negative is that the ""hitch"" for the trailer does not lock in place and can be turned causing the trailer to come off at bad times, but we would still recommend it.  The assembly was easy and our little farmer has been thrilled!",149,Baby_toddler_toys
150,Pedal Farm Tractor,I bought this for my son when he was 3 years old.  He is now 8 and handed it down to my younger son when he turned 2.  After 5 years of rough and tough riding it is just now starting to break down.  This has been an awesome toy.  We also purchased the trailer and the boys have loved them both.  I think it would have lasted even longer if my 8 year old would have stayed off of it after he had outgrown it.  Anyway the only thing you need to keep in mind is that there is no brake so be careful on hills.,150,Baby_toddler_toys
151,Pedal Farm Tractor,"We bought this tractor to accompany the trailer.  Our grandsons are big into farm stuff and love to load up the trailer and pretend they are working """"on the farm.""""  It is best for those old enough to reach the pedals (age 3 and up?).  It is very sturdy and durable.  Great toy for those busy toddlers and preschoolers.  Worth every penny it cost!",151,Baby_toddler_toys
152,Pedal Farm Tractor,"We bought this tractor for our 2 and a half-year-old son, and he is able to pedal and manuever this vehicle very well, despite the recommended age of 3-6 years. This tractor is very sturdy, and nearly impossible to tip over. My son has deserted all other riding toys in favor of this tractor. I highly recommend purchasing the yellow trailer that is specifically made for this tractor, but is sold separately .... My son loads all kinds of treasures into the trailer and farms the yard for long periods of time....",152,Baby_toddler_toys

He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We've traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don't take up much space since they nest.  The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands.",159,Baby_toddler_toys
160,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"This is a great toy.  The wheels really work and each car has a special feature.  They store easily for packing on trips and putting away.  Both of my kids (boy and girl) have played with them.  They are brightly colored.  And best of all, these do not use batteries!",160,Baby_toddler_toys
161,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My 11 month old received these last Christmas and he instantly began running them along the floor and playing with them. He is now 22 months and I have taught him his colors using these and he STILL loves to play with them.  One got run over by an electric scooter and it didn't even break! All parents should get these for your baby.  This is the one toy that will NOT sit and collect dust!,161,Baby_toddler_toys
162,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My 14 month old son loves to stack and play with these little cars.  They are durable and easy to clean.  I throw them in  the diswasher and they hold up great.  They are well worth the money to me.,162,Baby_toddler_toys
163,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"Great toys, we always pack one or two in the diaper bag, our 7 month old loves to play with them and I don't worry at all about him chewing on these toys as there are only smooth surfaces",163,Baby_toddler_toys
164,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My son has played with these from 6 months old, and still likes them occasionally (18 months now).  The small car is nice for babies to shake.  They don't do much, but they are cute.",164,Baby_toddler_toys
165,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,After being inundated with toys that require batteries and make so much noise this was a breath of fresh air. My son loves these vehicles! We got this when he was 6 months old. We stack them on top and he loves to knock it over. We nest them and he loves to find the surprise vehicle underneath. Now that he is 8 months old he is figuring out that the wheels move as well as some of the other moving features on each vehicle. I highly recommend this toy.,165,Baby_toddler_toys
166,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I bought these for my 1 1/2 year old, and he loves them (and so does his 5-year old brother). They both stack the cars, hide them and ""vrroomm"" them. It is great to find a toy that doesn't need batteries or require an engineering degree to put together!Highly recommended.",166,Baby_toddler_toys
167,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,We bought these trucks for our 15 mo. old daughter and 4 mo. old son- We love them!  They are nesting which is fun for our daughter to look underneath the trucks to find the next one or they can stack one on top of the other to make a tower.  Perfect first trucks!  And they aren't too big- a perfect size!,167,Baby_toddler_toys
168,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My son got this stacking truck set as a baby gift.  He was able to play with the trucks at about 6 months and they are still played with today (my son will be 2 next month). The overall durability of this toy is great; they look as good as when we got them even after lots of play and being taken along on many trips. I have not seen this toy in any store - so get it here while you still can!  It has been a much used toy and I highly recommend it for your small child.,168,Baby_toddler_toys
169,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I bought the cars because they were easy to store, plus they were cars.  What I have found is that I can actually use then in many places since there is more than one vehicle.  Mostly they are easy to pack for a trip.",169,Baby_toddler_toys
170,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"My daughter loves these vehicles. She likes to watch them disappear as you stack them inside each other. And she loves to stack them atop of each other. Then she plays with them as cars, and even makes the sounds they make. They are wonderful fun toys, and great to take with you on trips, they are compact!",170,Baby_toddler_toys
171,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My son loves this stacking toy. It is much more fun than the stackable rings toy even though he does have that one too. All the boys at our baby group have it and the babies who don't always come up to see what it is all about! You can't go wrong with this purchase.,171,Baby_toddler_toys
172,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"I got this toy for my daughter when she was very little.  She really hasn't been interested until recently.  Now she loves to put little people inside the cars and look at them through the top.  She lets objects play hide-and-seek under the cars but she really doesn't stack them or nest them very much.  I think they are worth the money because they were fairly cheap but she hasn't really used them for the intended purpose.  I don't think I would buy them again but I certainly wouldn't take them back if they were given to me. I think my daughter will use them in different ways with other toys, in the tub or pool or even outside as she grows.  They are extremely durable.",172,Baby_toddler_toys
173,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"Okay, well they don't really beep.  (But my 11-month old son loves when we roll these along and SAY &quot;beep beep!&quot;)  At this point, my son's favorite aspect of these cars is the little sunroof, siren and ladder on the tops.  He can sit there for ten minutes just flipping the sunroof back and forth!  Go figure!  These cars are super sturdy and have taken quite a beating on our coffee table.  (They're in much better shape than the coffee table at this point.)  I love that they nest together so they don't take up too much space when they're put away.  I also like that he can grow into them once he understands the nesting/stacking part better.  A great toy...gets played with each and every day!",173,Baby_toddler_toys
174,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"For well over a year my son has enjoyed stacking and playing with these cars. They have held up brilliantly to his abuse - they still look like new.

175,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"We just bought this for my 9 month old daughter,she loves these cars, loves to turn the wheels and lookat the faces.

176,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My son got this for Christmas and he loves all the cars.  His favorite is the fire truck.  He plays with it for a while.,176,Baby_toddler_toys
177,Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item.",177,Baby_toddler_toys
178,Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control,"My mother-in-law bought 2 of these for our twin boys-- one for each crib-- and they have been a life saver in getting our boys to settle down at night and go to sleep. Now our boys do not sleep without it! Anytime we are going somewhere overnight, we take at least one with us. It is also the only toy that plays music by itself for more than 30 sec. It will play for about 10 minutes!! It's our standard gift for all of our parent friends.",178,Nursery
179,Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control,"My daughter had this in her crib until she was 2 and loved it.  When she got old enough she loved to turn it on and off by herself.  I used this every night for her to go to sleep by. I used the place that you store the remote control in for extra pacifiers, so if she lost one during the night she would know where to find one.  I never used the remote, but loved the idea another had about putting in the car for rear facing infants when they get fussy you could just turn it on with the remote.  It's not too bright and the volume is adjustable.  Someone had said it eat batteries quickly,but I found that they lasted a very LONG time and I used it EVERY night. I highly recommend this product!!",179,Nursery
180,Fisher-Price Slumbertime Soother with Remote Control,I bought this product when my son was about 10 months old.  He was still having problems going to sleep at night and naptime.  The Slumbertime Soother is great.  I sing along with the songs.  My son turns it on himself and sometimes just plays with it.  The nature sounds relax him.  I really like the fact that it plays for ten minutes without stopping.,180,Nursery

184,Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"My son loved this toy.  He enjoyed playing with it in his highchair until he was 10 months old.  At that point he was strong enough to pull the toy from its' base.  He pulled it so hard, he smashed himself in the face with it.  After that upsetting experience, we didn't put it in the base anymore.  He did still play with it as a rattle, but it did not hold his attention as well.  I would like to see this toy redesigned so that it cannot be separated from its' base.",184,Nursery
185,Sassy 836 - Fascination Station,"My son is nearly a year old and received this toy about 9 months ago.  We both love Sassy toys.  This one is bright and amusing.

What more could mom ask for??",188,Baby_toddler_toys
189,Sassy Circle Rattle,"What I don't love about this is that the clear part, where the baby can watch the beads move with motion, contains BPA.  However, my daughter found this rattle a comfort to her while teething and chewed only the big protruding ball, which as far as I know is free from both PVC and BPA.  I thought she would like the textures of the rings, but nope, it was all about the ball.Also appreciated the bright colors.  This is a good bang for your buck baby toy -- for a while there we always had it in the diaper bag when we left the house.Best at about 6-12 months.  Can't see it getting a lot of use before 3 months and just not interesting to a toddler, even a toddler who is still teething.",189,Baby_toddler_toys

We filled it with pictures of mom and dad, 2 sets of grandparents, and all the cousins with their families (there are only 6 slots for pics, but we took pictures of entire families - so we have 20 people in all).  She loves pointing to the pictures and identifying various people.  The pages are made out of thin plastic material and filled with foam, so are pretty soft, but still durable. The slots are sized for 3x5 inch pictures.  My 4 month old hasn't gotten much out of it yet, but I'm sure he'll love it just as much in months to come.",193,Gift

Since then, Earl has seen us through teething for three kids, and is still in good condition for our fourth baby!  He's a little faded around the edges, but just as loveable and soft, with difference textures for a chewy, drooly baby to gnaw on.I like that he's fully washable, and a nice quiet toy (at least in ours, the squeaker was very quiet to begin with and has since kind of stopped squeaking--but the squeaker was never the big attraction with Earl).  Perfect for taking on planes, or in church, or in the car. A great baby shower gift, since Earl is perfect for a boy or a girl.",196,Baby_Care

It went with my newborn son everywhere we went because it fit perfectly with him in his carrier and it was a cute, small toy we could use to interact with.  At 9-months-old he's not at that age where he's hugging, chewing, just all out playing with his toys and he likes it for that reason.  But babies need more that just stuffed animals.  He's obviously much more interested in toys that make sounds or light so his Pooh mostly stays in his room with the other 'dolls'.This is still a cute item.  I haven't had to wash it yet, but it sure is durable.",224,Baby_stationary

Yaayyyy!!Fifteen years ago, I bought my daughter a little push clown from the same company.  It was her favorite toy & was passed onto her brother.

226,Infant Stim-mobile,"Love this mobile!  It is challenging and their eyes are drawn to it.  My son couldn't look at it until he got older as he didn't like high contrast, but at @ 7 mo he got into it.  If you are a parent who appreciates observing the small nuances of learning that occur in the development process--you will be able to witness it with this toy.  I'm not a parent trying to turn my children into geniuses, but definitely into maximizing their capabilities to incite their own curiosities.  Keeping children zoned out is not a priority--so for those who want to do that--turn on the tv and buy toys with bells and whistles.  For others, get toys like this one.",226,Activity_entertainment
227,Infant Stim-mobile,"We found this at a garage sale and I read about it and it seemed really interesting so I bought it. This is for the first few months of a baby's life and should not move much, contrary to what the first poster said, because you want stimulation but you don't want to over-stimulate a baby. However, we did notice that sometiems our baby does like the mobile to move and it is summer here but the air conditioner blowing air around the room should be enough movement. When it's not moving, we can just put a small fan on its lowest setting about 6 feet from the crib and the small wiggling was enough movement to keep her stimulated but not so much movement that she can't keep track of the object (babies this young are not good at tracking so you don't want a lot of motion), but still we only do this once in a while, not at all times.One of the best things about this mobile is that our baby only wakes us up at night to feed. If she wakes herself up she will sit and stare at it for a long time and be happy since we have a small nightlight in the room. Any time we put her in the crib we can see her staring at the simple shapes. Shown in the picture on the product page is the detailed shapes, you flip the cardboard from the simple to the detailed shapes when they are about 2 months old, then remove this mobile for a more 'traditional' one with movement and objects the baby can grab at about 4 months. This is a somewhat delicate mobile since it uses air currents to move, so you need to keep it safe from a grabbing/eating baby.Also, one nice feature is that ours came with a travel pack, or at least that's how I'm using it. Besides the crib mount, there is an 8 inch circular plastic ring with fishing wire for hanging the mobile. You can hang it anywhere with a string, either taping string to the ceiling or tying it to any overhang. It also came with a cardboard carrying case thing which is very thin and easy to take with you on a trip.For those with a math/science background, it's really interesting to note that first side of the cards have objects with very low spatial frequency. The 'detailed' sides are actually the same patterns, but with a moderately higher spatial frequency. After 4 months, you use standard mobiles, which have very high spatial frequencies, as well as colors and things the baby can grab to improve hand-eye coordination. Basically, you start showing the child very low frequency objects that are easy to observe and track, then gradually move up until they can use the high frequency information.Now, I want to explain why I did not give this item 5 stars even though it's an amazing product. Before my baby was a month old, I noticed that she was already able to detect some colors and this stim-mobile is only black and white. This is from 1990, so I guess over the last 20 years they have refined the product so that the simple side has some red (first color a baby sees) and other simple colors, while the reverse side has more vivid colors, but uses the same idea of going from low spatial frequencies to higher spatial frequencies. I ordered the newest version but still kept this around for changing table and pack n play entertainment since she loves it. If I had not known about the improved version, I would have given it 5 stars, but there is something better available so I highly recommend getting the updated version for every newborn.",227,Activity_entertainment

This set challenges kids mentally as they try to figure out a. how to roll a ball b. how to aim the ball c. how to knock the pins down d. how to pick up the wobbly little guys. also you can tell your child 'aim for the red guy' or 'aim for the yellow guy'. great for teaching basic colors and counting too. don't forget you can always say WOW you knocked ONE over...and so forth. great all around and gets tossed around too so clearly after using for a month and being bashed on teh floor by little hands trying to figure out how to bounce the not bouncy ball (exploration) nothing has broken.",229,Baby_toddler_toys

231,Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,"This product was very innovative when introduced in 1997-8.  It sold at FAO Schwarts for about $100 and we got it for our 18 month old daughter.  She used it until she was at least 3 (we then moved to Reader Rabbit).  The way it worked then -  you plugged the key board into the printer port and the sw was on two CDs. The keyboard did not require mouse skills, just visual selection of very large buttons.  Very interactive, very educational for the toddler/preschool set.  The developer was Israeli and they did not have good US distribution.  It now seems that they finally found someone to distribute it.",231,Baby_stationary
232,Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,"I have to say, the first time we played with this I thought it was going to be a dud and I was thinking I would send it back.  It's very simple and not much interaction to it.  But it turns out my 2 year old daughter loves it.  She gets a kick out of it and it's all she needs in a toy.(This is the Comfy PC and not the Elmo toy.)",232,Baby_stationary
233,Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,"My daughter loves this product! It covers her 2 favorite things the PC and the phone! Whenever I am on the computer she is always on my lap trying to push whatever keys she can, but with this I can put her in her highchair and put her in front of the PC and she will entertain herself for at least an hour!  She espicially loves the phone aspect on the side and what I love is there is no cord to worry about. I would definitely reccommend this to anyone with a toddler, I started using this with my daughter when she was 12 months old, she is now 15 months and loves it more now that she has gone up to another level!",233,Baby_stationary
234,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"all three of my kids have had one of these teethers, and it's been the favorite for all of them. i buy one for any expectant friend or family member. in our experience, the batteries last about a year & 1/2.",234,Baby_Care
235,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I've tried this for almost 6 months at different points of our kid teething and she's just not that into this. It's really heavy for a baby. When I would hold the vibrating setting on my kid would watch for a bit and even try it but just seemed bored with it and would move on. The yellow part also attracts dust and fiber out of the air like a magnet. It is ALWAYS dirty. I'm not that particular when it comes to dirt and baby stuff but it grosses me out. It's also only wire clean, so it's a more high maintenance toy.",235,Baby_Care
236,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"This teether is ridiculous. It's huge, it's hard to clamp down on, and my daughter had no idea what was going on when it started vibrating in her mouth.It's just too big, awkward, and hard to push down on. Not worth the money, in my opinion.",236,Baby_Care
237,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,One of my friends recommended this for me for my daughter when she was teething. It was the only thing that made her stop crying when she was teething and I tried everything imaginable. I had to hold it to make it vibrate because her mouth wasn't strong enough but it made her so happy and cuddly that is far from a complaint. Have recommended it to lots of my friends and they all love it.,237,Baby_Care
238,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"Great teether as it has a good texture, is easy to handle and massages the gums while baby is chewing on it.",238,Baby_Care
239,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I ordered this product after reading many of the other reviews, and I'm also pleased with this purchase. My daughter is 10-months-old and her first tooth just came through, and we'd tried everything to soothe her gums: ice cubes, teething rings, cold washcloths, you name it. At first she wasn't terribly interested in the toy, but then I took it and put it in my mouth and handed it back to her. She put it in her mouth, and I squeezed the other side to make it vibrate. The look on her face was priceless! Her eyebrows went up and I noticed she bit down harder (so I could let go), and she seemed to really like the vibration. This has since become her go-to toy when her gums seem to bother her. Also, I discovered she likes to have the little roller on the handle rubbed up and down her back. All in all this is a really well made toy that worked for my daughter exactly how I'd hoped.",239,Baby_Care
240,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,my 5mth old daughter really likes this teething toy. it has just the right amount of vibration and it triggered easily enough where she can activate it herself with little effort. i like that the 3 sides of the star have different ribbing so it feels different on her gums. great product for the money and a must have for a teething baby.,240,Baby_Care
241,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My 10 month old grandson thought the movement of this toy was funny! He laughs when it moves! Saying this, he does put it in his mouth but pulls it out to laugh So, I love this Teether because it makes him so happy NOT because it massages his teeth!",241,Baby_Care
242,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My four month old started teething around two months, he has pretty impressive motor skills when it comes to using his hands but this teether is huge and you really have to apply quite a bit of pressure for it to vibrate. My other son who is two and also teething shows absolutely no intrest in this at all. Maybe in a couple more months....",242,Baby_Care
243,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,It is a good teether for my handicapped student. But the ability to bit down is required which is hard for my student.,243,Baby_Care
244,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"It is a great toy for them to chew and play with, but it is a bit harder for smaller babies to chew on. The vibration was a bit stronger than I was expecting, but it does not seem to bother my son a bit.",244,Baby_Care
245,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My daughter is two months and loves this in her mouth.  She seem to like the points and the softer rubber than theInfantino Vibrating Strawberry Teether.  Also it requires less pressure to make vibrate.  No she is not teething yet and no she cannot make it vibrate yet.  But if you pinch it for her, their are three different point surfaces and yes she has her favorite.  If she is getting a bit cranky, there are times this will turn her back into all smiles.  At this point, she seems to ""chew"" and vigorously suck on the points.",245,Baby_Care
246,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,This is a good idea but it takes a lot of pressure for my 7 month old granddaughter to make it vibrate.  I can squeeze one corner to make it vibrate while she chews on the other end.  Otherwise she chews it like a regular teething you.,246,Baby_Care
247,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"The older one of these lasted us several years for my special needs daughter who likes the vibration. This one lasted 3 months before the battery died. Folks, you need to work on battery life or just go back to the old style teether!",247,Baby_Care
248,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"A must in addition to all the teething toys. Next to Sophie the giraffe this is his favorite. I. Don't really know if the vibration massages. His gums, but he does enjoy biting into it a lot!",248,Baby_Care

250,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,This product sucks. My little boy LOVES to chew on things while he's teething - and he bites down hard. He was never able to bite hard enough to get this dumb thing to vibrate. Very disappointing.,250,Baby_Care
251,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"The yellow part vibrates once little gums/teeth chomp down on it. easy to hold on to, can easily hook (Via rings or carabiner) to a diaper bag etc. Both my kids loved it while teething.",251,Baby_Care
252,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,My son is 4 months old and can not quite get a hang of other teethers. Some of them you have to bend in a specific direction to make the vibration happen. This teether is great. They just bite down (naturally) and the vibration helps with the comfort. I love it!,252,Baby_Care
253,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,This arrived the next day after I bought it and I was very grateful!  We had one other one that my son managed to lose and he was miserable without it!  It really helped soothe his mouth while he was teething!,253,Baby_Care
254,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I have two of these teethers and both see variable use as my little guy goes through teething spurts.In between, he actually likes sitting or kneeling on the star to get it to vibrate.But as soon as his gums start hurting, he goes straight for this toy.Also, it's a smart packaging extra to have the 'free ring' on top which clearly doubles for hanging purposes.",254,Baby_Care
255,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"My son is obsessed with this teether!! He was first more fascinated with spinning the bottom part and chewing on that but after 4 months of having it, he has now switched and loves the rubber/vibrating part. I don't know what I would do without this one, I think it is a must have! Not only a teether but a toy as well :)",255,Baby_Care
256,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I bought this for upcoming teething, and we still don't seem to be there, but my baby just thinks this thing is good fun.  She bites on it and the vibration cracks her up.  That's enough for me!",256,Baby_Care
257,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,My LO is definitely teething and I've tried giving this to her but she can never get the massager to go at it on her own.  I will have to put it in her mouth and press it at the same time.  She looks at me and I imagine her thinking &#34;what the heck is that&#34; and she pulls her face away.  I'm hoping she'll want to use it again before her teeth actually come in since I can't return it at this point.  We're sticking to the fake keys and her little Sophie the Giraffe for now.,257,Baby_Care
258,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"Bought this based on the reviews. My daughter is an early teether at 3 months old. My only complaint is that she has a hard time activating the vibration by biting hard enough. This has allot to do with her age. I have to hold one of the corners for her to activate the vibration. She LOVES it, I only wish it had an on/off switch so I didn't have to hold it for her. She actually cries when I try to take it away from her.",258,Baby_Care
259,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,My baby loves the vibrations on his teeth. He also shakes it like a rattle. This product is good quality.,259,Baby_Care
260,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,I've bought several teethers and this i one of the best ones. The vibration helps ease the discomfort and the colors make it also very interesting.,260,Baby_Care
261,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I know it's a safety feature, but it is unfortunate that the batteries are not replaceable in this, because I will probably have to buy another one of these soon, because my little one LOVES this.  He seemed to hate all other teething options out there...even Sophie he had to learn to love (he's does like it now), but this he gnaws away on vigorously.The star shaped chewing part is a little big and that worried me a bit when I first got it, but it actually hasn't seemed to bother him that much.  So far (he got this at 5 months) he can't always make the vibration happen himself but, 1)It's not that difficult for me to just push down on it as I'm holding it for him since I like how it calms him down and 2) even when it doesn't vibrate, he still loves to chew away at it.  He has learned over time a bit better about how hard to bite down to make it go too and that it will go by chewing on any of the three available &#34;tips&#34; to the star.He also really likes the little spinning rattle on the end and it has little nibs that he likes to chomp on too (even though it is hard plastic and the star is rubber like).  It is a &#34;substantial&#34;  toy though, so if your little one is in the phase of swinging toys around really hard, they may bonk themselves now and again, but our son seemed relatively un-phased by that.",261,Baby_Care
262,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,I got this for my son when he was about 8 months. he loved bitting it and he carry it all over the house. He is now 18 months and it still works plus he still bits on it too. I found it very easy to clean too.,262,Baby_Care
263,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"This thing is big. Baby can grow into it. It really does help when I hold it and turn it on for him. If he isn't done with it he is sure to let me know. Which to me translates that he likes it. I'm not sure how I feel about the sticky feeling plastic, seems unnecessary and everything sticks to it.",263,Baby_Care
264,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"If I can recommend one teether to buy for your teething baby, it would be this one. The vibration made it fun and it took the edge off for my little guy. The shape/handle made it really easy for him to hold. We never leave the house without this thing and it is the go-to gift I give to all my expecting friends.",264,Baby_Care
265,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"Baby loves this teether. Nice to have something different from all of the other teethers out there. The nice thing is that when she no longer wants it to vibrate, she still has fun the with handle the spins. Great product and it has lasted despite being thrown all around.",265,Baby_Care
266,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I had bought a similar toy like this in the 90's for my daughter when she was teething and now she has children. I bought one for my grandson, then more recently this one for my granddaughter. Babies love the sensation it gives them when their front teeth are coming out and making them miserable. I believe it relieves them of some of their pain and I highly recommend any parent with teething babies to get this toy for them! It is a sturdy product and you don't have to worry about any little parts coming loose or damaged. My babies and grandkids abused theirs and it still took the beating.",266,Baby_Care
267,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"We have another vibrating teether that is very similar to this one, there are some differences though.This one is much softer on the outside which could be nice on tender gums.This one has 3 points that she can use to pin point the problem area.Each point has a different texture (bumps, ridges) so there is some varianceThis one seems like it is easier to activateI will say that I don't know if she favors one for the other.  It seems like she uses them both about equally.She also likes to play with it by making it vibrate on her hands, feet, cheeks etc.  We have had a lot of fun playing with it.It's a great find and I wish I had come across it sooner.",267,Baby_Care

269,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,A favorite in our house!,269,Baby_Care
270,The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"I had this very teether for my twin boys 8 years ago and they absolutely loved it.  So, when my new baby started teething, I sought out the same teether.  I was surprised when it arrived and the packaging stated that the product is, ""safety tested"" for BPA, lead, and phthalates.  It does not state ANYWHERE on the package that it is BPA free.  As a former regulator (of medical devices) I am very sensitive about company labeling and statements.  Perhaps too much so.  But, I would rather err on the side of caution where my child is concerned, and the lack of clear ""BPA free"" labeling on this product gives me pause.  Specifically, when they test it for BPA, lead, and phthalates, is there an acceptable amount allowed?!  If not, why wouldn't the company simply label the product as BPA, lead, and phthalate free?Eight years ago, when I gave this toy to my sons, no one had ever heard of BPA.  My boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths, and I'm sure it was all riddled with BPA.  But, in this day and age, when BPA is strongly suspected of being dangerous, I cannot in good conscience allow my new baby to chew on anything that MAY contain it.  And, though someone on this site indicated that a representative from the company TOLD them it was BPA free, I'm still skeptical.  Again, why not label it as such?  Most companies proudly label their products with that simple language that cannot be confused.",270,Baby_Care
271,The First Years Soft Teething Beads,"My son has had this teether since he was 3 months old. I thought maybe he's just too young & not interested in it(even though he did have 2 teeth already) He is now 8 months old, and still isn't very interested in this teether. The reason I bought it was because it was in-expensive and easy for him to hold & pick up. He would rather pick up a toy car, or some sort of stuffed toy, which I understand every child is different. My only big complaint - the star bead on the end. It is hard, and pointy. If it catches my son's sore, in-coming teeth the wrong way, he will cry. Other then that, the colors are great, and definitely catch baby's eye. Overall, it's an OK toy for the price.",271,Baby_Care
272,The First Years Soft Teething Beads,"This teething ring is great!  We probably have enough toys to have our own toy store, including at least 2-3 of these teething rings! Our 10-mth-old baby loves to stick one of them in his mouth (like just one bead of it) and walk or crawl around with his hands free to hold other toys.  Our 7-mth-old, loves it too, with his favorite game being to simply have one of us sit it on his head and then wait for it to fall off when he moves.  He thinks it is hestarical.  It's amazing how much fun they can have with such a simple toy.",272,Baby_Care

275,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I bought this for my 8 week old daughter, we are planning a trip to Texas and did not want to take the heavy stroller...I tried her in the sling,she got very hot and because of that she got heat rash all over her face and neck (she was only in the sling for about 10 minutes)!!!! I did not like all the padding, it makes it to bulky! On top of all that it gave me a back ache!!If you are serious about a sling I would choose the Maya, it is a thinner material, and is not bulky at all. That is what I ended up buying, and my daughter loves it and so do I.",275,Baby_Care
276,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I thought this would be an excellent item to have. I was wrong! This is the most cumbersome thing I own and my son sweats like crazy in it. There's no support for the baby's neck or back, and I always feel like he's about to fall out of it. Unless you've got really strong shoulders or a feather-weight infant, you might want to skip the infant carrier thing completely. Save yourself time and money on this - I wouldn't buy it again!!",276,Baby_Care
277,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"It is a little awkward at first, but I had an extremely premature baby who was too small for the traditional carriers, and needed to be held all the time.  I lived, cooked, did laundry, ate, and slept with this sling for 2 months.  Once my baby was bigger and needed to be held less I started using other carriers.  But now I'm back to the sling because quite frankly, once you get the hang of it, its much, much easier to get baby in and out of it.",277,Baby_Care
278,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I think the idea behind the sling is great but it is not for every baby.  Everytime our son is put in this he crys or screams.  He is an easy going fellow but he hasn't liked being held to closely.  He wants his freedom and this doesn't give much freedom to a newborn.  Also, the &quot;training&quot; video is more of a promotional advertisement.  I had to go to the web site to get more information about how to use it.",278,Baby_Care
279,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,This is a great product but it is just too big for me. If you are 5'5&quot; inch. and below please do not get this cause it will look like a sack on you.  My baby was terrified and looked uncomfortable in it. She cried everytime I put her inside. Practice makes perfect but eventually my baby &amp; I got tired of using this.,279,Baby_Care
280,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"After reading all the great reviews on the sling I decided to try one.  We both hated it. Maybe because I'm 5'1 and my son was eleven pounds when he was born made it more difficult. I kept trying to make it work for us but after 6 months I gave it up. I ended up giving it away. It's not one size fits all. If you're short, think twice on this.",280,Baby_Care
281,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I used this sling for both of my babies, (0-&gt; 2.5yrs). We had a front backpack style which was good for about 3 months, until the weight of the baby started to make my back ache.The best thing about this sling, besides the fact that the kids loved riding in it, is that it folds up into a reasonably size bundle that fit in my diaper bag. So as the kids aged, and wanted to walk on their own I could just toss this carrier in the diaper bag for when they got tired. Also with the kid riding either in front or on your hip, they are very accessible, so that you can hand them something, like a bottle or a bit of food when you are on the go. (Say like walking around at the Zoo.)I must admit I liked the hip carry position best, it mimic's having my arm under their butt, and holds them close.Anyway its reasonably priced, you'll get your use out of it, (unlike the front only carriers, which as I mentioned aren't good for very long, or the backpack carriers, which while are good for that heavy load, don't pack up and so aren't with you when you need them.)",281,Baby_Care

283,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"Every time I hear a parent say that they tried a sling, but baby hated it, or it was a pain, or they just ended up not using it, this was the sling they tried.  People who love their slings used a Maya Wrap, Over the Shoulder Baby Holder, or New Native sling.  All of which come in great fabric choices and are easy to use.",283,Baby_Care
284,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I am the the mother of a 14 week old who has reflux and is uncomfortable sleeping in a crib or anywhere flat. She wants to be held *all* the time, and it was getting pretty exhausting in our arms (and my chronic tendonitis was flaring up) until we ordered the sling after reading about it in Dr. Sears's The Baby Book.  I had my doubts, but boy has it been a lifesaver!The sling has been invaluable for me, my husband, and our regular sitter. With it, we are able to walk, bounce, give the calming pinky finger treatment, and see what's going on with the baby. She started using the sling at 2 weeks, when she was about 7 pounds. It took a few times, but she is now completely comfortable in it and it is a favorite napping spot.As I am large-breasted, I did find it awkward to breastfeed in it, although I've been able to do it successfully a couple of times in public sitting down.  The fabric is soft and easily washable (important for those baby mishaps).  The padding helps me feel comfortable as a bit of protection in case of bumping.  The size is very adjustable for different height people, although you may need to pull through a lot of fabric to bring small babies in tightly, especially if you have a smaller chest size.The NoJo sling would benefit from having some loose fabric at the end to cover the baby's head in the sun and provide more coverage during breastfeeding. The stopper piece of plastic at the end of the fabric adds safety (it won't pull through), however it can whack the baby if you aren't careful when getting it on or off.  It could also use a zippered storage area, a feature of some other slings.  Also, the blue with plaid seems to be the only fabric sold these days, although I have seen other patterns and colors on eBay.  This is fine with jeans, but not great when you have to go to a wedding, as I did with the sling earlier this summer. I think it also makes people think that she's a boy, for some reason.  Maybe it's the blue and the fact that they can't see her cute dresses!The sling is also helpful in keeping interested strangers at a slight distance away from the baby -- they are less able to grab at her, which I think is good from a germ perspective, especially for newborns. When it is very hot or humid out, this sling can be a bit heavy for the baby (especially up against a hot mama!), but on cooler days the fabric adds just the right amount of warmth, like a light blanket.When I was pregnant, I assumed the Baby Bjorn would be all we would need. Instead it hangs on a hook most of the time unless we're going for a long walk or shopping -- activities where having two hands is important and you'll be doing them for a while. That thing is so hard to get on and off! Plus, you aren't supposed to use it until they are 8 lbs. The baby seems to really like the flexibility of positioning with the sling -- especially curling up happily in a womb-like ball -- and sometimes gets irritated by being all dangled out in the Bjorn.Carrying the baby in the sling makes you so much more mobile than using a stroller or lugging her around in her heavy carseat, so I use it whenever I anticipate being in public where they are stairs, space issues, or other impediments.  It's good for short shopping trips as well, especially if you're with a friend who can carry things or push a cart, both of which are harder to do with the sling on.She's also a million times more comfortable in the sling than in her car seat, where she often cries.  Our NoJo Babysling has been in constant use since it arrived, and ties the bouncy seat (where she mostly sleeps by day) as the best return on investment of any of the baby gizmos we bought.  Our sitter will often wear the baby for her entire nap. The sitter just sits (often in a rocking chair or porch swing to provide some more movement) and reads while the baby sleeps.One last thing that's great is that when the baby falls asleep, she can be laid down on the bed or bouncy chair and the sling just slips off the wearer without waking the baby.I did not watch the video, but did read the sling chapter in the Baby Book, which was helpful. We have recently started using the kangaroo (facing out) position as the baby loves looking at the outside world now. It's nice to have this sort of flexibility.  If you are getting tired carrying around your baby, and would like an extra hand free, a sling is a great investment and while not the most elegant, the NoJo is a good workhorse one to use on a daily basis.",284,Baby_Care
285,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I love Dr. Sear's books, but this baby sling is much too large!  I am a slightly small framed 5'5"" woman.  My 6'5"" husband wears this sling just fine.  But, for a sling to work for YOU, it MUST FIT properly!  I finally bought a sling that fit me when my son was over 1 year old.  I couldn't believe what a difference it made and felt so sad that I hadn't tried a different sling sooner. My son loves sitting in it on my hip and brings it to me whenever I am working in the kitchen. Try the Rosado sling or any other brand that comes in sizes and buy the size that fits your body!  You will really be able to enjoy the baby wearing experience that Dr. Sears recommends so highly!",285,Baby_Care
286,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I think slings are some of the most useful items for babies. They make nursing so easy, even while walking around on the street or in a busy store. I love the Sears Library, so I thought the Sears NoJo sling would be great. While I did use it for a long time, and would still recommend it over a front or back carrier (at least for the first few months), I found that this sling was difficult to adjust and my baby seemed to disappear in the first month or so. For small babies I prefer a sling with no railings, and more adjustable. The New Native sling and many others offer this. I would shop around online, there are many better slings than this.",286,Baby_Care
287,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"We purchased the Babysling when our daughter was 2 weeks old.  I was looking for a baby carrier that I could wear while nursing her that would be comfortable and discreet.  Initially, I found the sling very awkward to use.  I wasn't able to master nursing her in the sling until she was 2-3 months old.  However, as a carrier the babysling was great from the beginning.  Our daughter was colicy, and being able to put her in the sling all cozied up to either myself or my husband, hands free, was a God send.  This calmed her 90% of the time.  As the months went by, being able to wear her in the sling enabled me to get housework done without baby crying to be picked up - she was already up, and was able to be &quot;involved&quot; in my daily activities this way.There are many different ways to wear your baby in the sling, and that versatility has made it one of the best baby product purchases we made.  Our daughter is now 2 1/2 (30+ lbs.), and when she's having a rough &quot;toddler day&quot; will still occasionally ask for the sling.Be patient with the sling.  Practice with it, and if you can, find a friend who has used one successfully.  Dr. Sears also has a whole chapter on using a sling (any sling, not just this brand) in his book The Baby Book - great photos in there to help get the hang of things.One last remark... I have a friend who tried this sling and was unable to get it tight around her body (she's very petite).  There are other brands of slings (Maya Wrap, Over the Shoulder Baby Holder) that come in multiple sizes that might allow for a more customized fit.",287,Baby_Care
288,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"This sling is the third baby carrier I purchased, when the first two highly-promoted products were too uncomfortable.  My son was a premature baby who needed to be carried a lot for the first few months.  After we purchased this sling, my son basically lived in it!  The variety of cozy positions were perfect for his needs, and the sling fits so comfortably on both my husband and me that we don't even feel the weight of the baby when he's in it.  In fact, the weight of the baby is so evenly distributed that you don't develop the shoulder strain or lower back sway that other products gave us.  We would recommend this sling to anyone with a newborn or premature baby, and we continue to use it now that our son is a big 6-month old baby.  Buy it!",288,Baby_Care
289,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I got a regular carrier as a gift and I hated it! The baby would slide down in it, even though it says its for newborns. I have two other children and had to attend open house at two different schools. The first open house I had the baby in the carrier and it was awful. I ended up taking the baby out of it. My breastfeeding consultant told me about the sling an I went out and brought it right away. It is the best thing I could have ever got for myself and baby. The second open house was so much easier. The baby just bald up like in my womb and slept for the whole two hours. It was also great because I had both hands free to meet and greet the teachers. It comes in handy for breastfeeding discretly in public which for some moms is a must. The baby would sometimes get upset when taken out of the sling. I would recommend the sling to every mom every where!!!!!!",289,Baby_Care
290,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"My neighbor had the Nojo and liked it so I was going to get one too. I tried hers, but I couldn't get it tight enough so my baby hung down too low which didn't seem safe and hurt my back. I thought I could order a different size, but found it only comes in one size. I then read all the reviews here and followed someone's advice and ordered a from babymoon slings. It fit me better (I'm petite) and was a lot easier to use (and prettier!). I think it makes a big difference to get a sling that's not bulky and comes in sizes - I don't get why they use so much padding in the nojo, it makes it really hard to use with a newborn compared to other slings.",290,Baby_Care
291,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I have four children and have seen the benefits of the sling first-hand in varied situations.  My first was very small, and as a newborn, I thought he seemed lost in the sling so I exchanged it for a front-pack carrier.  Now I know that you can put a blanket or such in the sling to help cradle a newborn more securely.  It was a lost opportunity for us.  With the arrival of my second child, I decided to give it another try, as many of my friends raved about theirs and I'd need my hands free for my first child still.  I found the sling to be great for nursing, and afforded me privacy when I had to do so while out and about as I could pull the sling's fabric right over the baby and cover us both.  For a tired baby, it is much more conducive to sleeping than an upright carrier, and you can slip out of it and lay the baby down while still in the sling, if necessary.  My third child was (and still is) very cuddly, and enjoyed being next to me.  Since a mom's arms tire after a while, I found the sling a great way to incorporate baby into my routine without wearing myself out.  My fourth child turned our world upside-down with a very colicky start.  The &quot;insert-in-sling-and-go&quot; method was the only way to settle him down.  I could nurse, cook supper, do whatever I needed to do while keeping him close and moving, which was the key.  He learned to relax and even sleep while I was doing all sorts of things and making quite a racket at times.  Now at nearly three, he'll fall asleep while I'm driving and I can take him into the house, remove his coat and shoes, then carry him upstairs to bed without disturbing him.  I believe his learning to relax and sleep in the sling with so much going on around him has helped him in this area, too.  Most of all, it is just nice to have that close time with your little one in the sling, even if you are busy with other things to do.  I can't promise miracles, but this sling has been a crucial part of our early parenting and I recommend it highly!",291,Baby_Care
292,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I bought this babysling after reading about it in Dr. Sears' book.  My daughter was 2 months old and fussy!  Nothing seemed to work.  I was desperate!  Since the babysling was adjustable I thought it would fit all body types...not!  I am of average height but on the slimmer side.  It gave me alot of shoulder and back pain.  I rate this a one star because I found one use for it...I use it tied around my torso to carry my daughter on my back with the slight support of my hands. Back carrying is a bit tricky so don't try it alone!  I think baby slings are great but not this one is not for me.  If you are slimmer than average, try the New Native baby carrier.  It's portable and comes in different sizes.",292,Baby_Care
293,Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,I disagree with all of the reviews that say one size does not fit all. My Husbad is 6&quot;4 I am small frame 5&quot;2 and all we had to do when switching was move the adjustment. It was quite easy. We bought this after having the others. But they spread our daughter legs too far and she wanted to lie down at times not sit up. It was great because she could sit or lie down. And when she was very fussy it was the only way to get her to sleep. We then just slipped it off and put her down. IT was Great! Now that she is older I no longer use it but it was such a life saver I could not bring myself to get rid of it.  I not only recomend this but Dr. Sears book to anyone who has a fussy baby.,293,Baby_Care
294,"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Original Bassinet, Solid Toffee","I love the idea of the co-sleeper. I've seen some other concept designs by other companies and I hope they follow through with them. Arm's Reach has a bit of a monopoly on the co-sleepers right now. My little one hasn't arrived yet, so I haven't actually used it yet. Assembly is REALLY confusing. I don't know what happened to my paper instructions, but I can't find them. Luckily, there are some on the AR web page. But it is still so confusing.For those of us who are ardent Attachment Parenting, this is ideal. My older son, 15 months old, is still in bed with us and this Arm's Reach will give us the extra space for two little ones. We used the Snuggle Nest when our older boy was a small infant and that worked great. With two though, I wanted to keep the older away from the younger while they slept but still near us.If attachment parenting is a new concept for you, I strongly encourage you to read as much as you can online. Arm's Reach co-sleeper is a great way to co-sleep without the fear of suffocation.",294,Baby_Care

,"Nighttime Baby Diapers Size 3, 132 Ct, Huggies Overnites","The ordering and shipping was great, the diapers... not so much. What I did not know before buying is that these are a new design and not the same huggies overnight I had just used. We had diapers with mickey mouse on them and they were thick, soft, premium feeling, and they worked great without fail. The new ones have Winnie the pooh on them and they are much much thinner, are not as soft, feel very cheaply made, and provide an experience that makes you wonder who thought this was a good idea. There is, with no question, a completely Obvious lack of quality compared to the previous version. I'm learning this the hard way to the tune of 300 diapers. I guess I'll just use them as expensive daytime diapers and see if I can find the old version. If not ill look into a different brand. Very disappointed in the decision to change the diapers at all. My advice is to switch back to what works",,Baby_Care
,"Nighttime Baby Diapers Size 3, 132 Ct, Huggies Overnites","Huggies Overnites have saved me from having to wash my baby’s sheets every day. I started using them with my second child and loved them!

This is the best thing out there! You will not regret it.I buy the overnites for night time and the snug and dry for day time and nap time.",,Baby_Care
,"Nighttime Baby Diapers Size 3, 132 Ct, Huggies Overnites","I have a very active little sleeper who is now 18 months. I have tried many different brands of diapers, and before finding these, he'd be wet with pee in the morning on his pj's and bedding. Yes, he wears a onsie to help keep the diaper in place. For a while I was double diapering at night which seemed uncomfortable for him. Then I tried these night diapers and problem solved! I've been using these for the past 8 months and reordering as necessary. Each time I run out, my husband asks if our little one still needs these. So, each time, we try a few nights with our daytime diapers (kirkland) and again, major leaks at night until I buy another box.",,Baby_Care
,"Nighttime Baby Diapers Size 3, 132 Ct, Huggies Overnites","This diaper did wonders for us when my son started sleeping through the night. He was leaking every night and it was waking him up and making us all exhausted. We use these plus booster pads and don’t change him for 12 hours, when he wakes up. We have tried many brands and they all leak. Huggies overnight has only leaked on us a couple of times and I think it was when my son drank lots and lots of water before bed.My only issue with this diaper is that I think it is uncomfortable for my son. Huggies in general-not just overnights- tend to be very stiff/thick diapers. For the last couple of months after I put this diaper on my son, he will pull at his crotch area and whine and I ask him if it’s an “owie” and he says yes. I try to readjust it, but it’s still uncomfortable for him. This doesn’t happen with his “thinner” luvs.Overall I really like these diapers for overnight.",,Baby_Care

,"Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Crawl Around Car, stationary play center for babies and toddlers [Amazon Exclusive]
","Baby's first car is a keeper! I got this for my son who is a year old in a few days. We've had it since Christmas when he was about 10 months old. Even though the reviews were very good, I wasn't sure what could be so great about this stationary little car. I have to say that I am very impressed overall. It is easy to put together. It comes with accessories like balls and shapes that you can put through the appropriate holes in the car's sides. My son LOVES balls. So while they frequently end up all over the house, balls are his kingdom and he loves them.The car is really good for babies who are learning to pull themselves up. My son does crawl and scoot around it playing with all of the functions. He especially loves the ""radio."" I'm pretty sure this car taught him his sense of rhythm because he started dancing to the ""hip hop"" song and now his favorite thing to do is push the radio buttons and dance. He even stood up by himself dancing for the first time the other day. He's always playing with this car in one way or another. He likes to put his toys in the space where he's supposed to sit - but hey, it kind of helps me look like I've cleaned the living room. I throw things in closets and under the bed so if he wants to shove all his toys in the car so they're not scattered all over my living room floor - good on him! ;)It also looks like this is going to grow with him, which is always a plus - especially when products are on the more pricey side. I love toys that evolve with baby. I would definitely say that this is a good investment and that the right time to get it is when your babes start to crawl because it can really help them advance with their motor skills.The only mild compliant I have is that I have not heard 75 tunes and sayings. I hear maybe about 12 on rotation so I'm wondering where the heck the rest of them are or if this was a blip in advertising. It's definitely not a deal breaker but right now I'm living with the hip hop theme stuck in my head everywhere I go. My tot doesn't seem to mind one bit but I could use a change up, lol.",,Baby_stationary
,"Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Crawl Around Car, stationary play center for babies and toddlers [Amazon Exclusive]","I bought this car for my son's 1st birthday. He has already spent hours in it touching buttons, bouncing along to songs, using the shapes in the doors. It is a perfect size - not too big that it's obnoxious, and not too small the it's overlooked. This is by far his favorite toy. I would recommend this ! It's worth it!My only con - it was not very fun to put together. Lots of pieces, and stickers. It needed a philips head and several screws to be placed in order for it to fit together. It was not super easy and took 30-45 mins.Again, I am happy I purchased it, and I do think that it is worth it! He just loves it so much.",,Baby_stationary
,"Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Crawl Around Car, stationary play center for babies and toddlers [Amazon Exclusive]","Sure my 8 month old doesn’t “stay” in here, but that’s not what it’s for. It’s for entertainment and learning.Took me about 45 minutes to assemble myself- not terribly difficult just a bit tedious.Dropped it a star rating due to the fact each level(there’s 3), the sounds are super repetitive. 4 different songs/phrases. The sounds are also interrupted if you press another button so if you’re little ones hand is on the horn it’ll keep beeping over and over-if that makes sense.My son likes the 3 balls(don’t lose these. Nothing else fit) and he enjoys the 3 different shapes and the open shut noise the door makes.Appropriate for kiddos who can sit up unassisted for a long time until over 1. Plenty of space in the car, but if they are smaller they can get stuck or boop over.It’s pretty sturdy and heavy- just limited on the sounds. Worth the price? Not to me. Should be $39.99 but I bought it anyways.",,Baby_stationary
,"Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Crawl Around Car, stationary play center for babies and toddlers [Amazon Exclusive]","I purchased this car for my 11 month old after a friend recommended it to me. I am very disappointed. It is a week brand new, and I don't know why I didn't notice this earlier, but you can barely hear the car's noises even when the volume is on the highest setting. In fact, I don't notice any difference between the ""low"" setting and the ""high"" setting - they are both extremely quiet. I wanted this to be a fun interactive toy for my baby, but its disappointing. I would return it for another, but unfortunately, I was too quick to throw out the box and now I am stuck with a car that barely makes a sound. Very disappointed in this purchase.",,Baby_stationary

It was a great place to be able to sit him down and keep him entertained. I bought one the next day! It's very light, so I can easily move it from room to room (wherever we are all hanging out). The best part is that the baby's big sisters, ages 2.5 and newly 5, ALSO love it!

It is perfect for a “newly sitting baby” as it keeps him engaged in the sitting position, helping him build core strength. He loves the cause and effect play, especially beeping the horn. Be aware that the door opens easily so a younger baby can tip over and out of the car if he leans to closely to that side (once a stronger sitter this should not be an issue). Does require a screwdriver to put together and large stickers must be put on during assembly. I am looking forward to many months of play with this toy!",,Baby_stationary

The pair that is supposed to be cream is a pastel yellow and the brown pair have a green hue to them that doesn’t look good. Also the mustard yellow is just yellow, not mustard.

I threw my 3 month old in the display model as a joke to raise my wife's blood pressure and he* went nuts! and started playing with all the toys like crazy, he doesn't sit up yet on his own so seeing everything from this view and having a slight support from the foot base was great for him. He started spinning himself around and going from toy to toy like a mad child. Everyone in the store had to stop and watch him and I had to buy it because I have never seen him so active and excited on his own. Best investment I've made, it also turns into a table when he gets older. It's made out of great sturdy material, So dads if you want to buy your son/daughter this Gold Gym membership to get a true workout, this is a solid buy!.

I thought the foot area was springy, it’s not. Idk why I thought this, could be just me, just thought I’d let others know. We have one of those $10 door way jumpers so she gets her jumping exercise elsewhere..I bought this when my baby was 6 months old. I have a rather long torso’d baby girl, and before her legs were sturdy on the foot rest, the seat itself isn’t very deep, so she looked a little floppy in it. All was fine once her feet/legs reached better and when she began holding her own weight better. About one month after buying it... But for a long baby that doesn’t hold their own weight yet, it doesn’t look great at first. Shorter torso babies wouldn’t experience this.",,Activity_entertainment

We literally call it the poop machine and we send her for a ride anytime she's gone a day or so without a deposit. Best feature ever!.

But for me there were two major downsides that make me regret the purchase for the amount of money I paid for it. (1) My little guy often spit up and it got in the cracks around the peek through window. In an attempt to clean it we ended up scratching and breaking the window, and now it looks terrible and the keyboard no longer stays in it. Yes we broke it technically, but this is a huge oversight in design. The window should be removable for easy cleaning. I could not leave it the way it was. This has drastically reduced the value of it. (2) The piano has an off switch yet it still seems to turn off by itself after ~1 min even if you leave it turned on.

It’s also so incredibly awkward and tight to get him in. my baby isn’t even big..he’s actually on the smaller end and for some reason it was 10x harder to maneuver in and out than the fisher price. it’s also more expensive and doesn’t fold to be more compact for travel or when not in use...got the fisher price sit me and up and muuuuch happier with that!,,Activity_entertainment

The other thing is that the description says a one-month supply. My fault for not calculating how many diapers would constitute a one-month supply, but size 2 will last one month only if you use just 4 diapers a day.

The picture and video quality is super clear. The 2 way audio is cool so you can talk to the baby right through the monitor and hear if he or she is in distress. The installation and set up is very easy. It has a high powered sticky magnet and 2 seconds it's done. You can connect to 4 more cameras which is great. You can manually rotate 360 degrees from left to right and120° up and down for an easy visual. It has 3 settings of brightness for the built in night light which is perfect.

,"Hubble Connected Nursery Pal Connect Touch - 5"" HD Touch Screen Display and Wi-Fi Smart Video Baby Monitor, Remote Pan/Tilt/Zoom - Portable Wireless Camera – Interactive and Educational Content","Where do I start. I did a TON of research leading up to this purchase. My oldest child (who is now three) I used an Arlo baby for (and continue to use) but unfortunately Arlo no longer makes those cameras. I was super bummed and discouraged that I wouldn’t find a camera that I loved. I looked up every brand under the sun, read hundreds of reviews and in the end this camera came out on top. I was nervous because there was a few reviews talking about the camera saying out of range, but I figured I’d give it a shot. I was not disappointed. This camera is easy to install and to move around if needed, the range is actually pretty good. We live in the country and I can go quit a ways out from our house and it still picks up, I’ve only had a couple issues with the out of range and I’ve found that happens when my phone is right next to the monitor. Once I moved my phone it connected right back. Nightlight settings are great and plays music. If I had one complaint it would be the zoom out isn’t very far. You have to have the camera pretty high up to get a good view of your crib. But it isn’t horrible. If your looking for a camera for a cheap price but have good quality this is it.",,Nursery
,"Hubble Connected Nursery Pal Connect Touch - 5"" HD Touch Screen Display and Wi-Fi Smart Video Baby Monitor, Remote Pan/Tilt/Zoom - Portable Wireless Camera – Interactive and Educational Content","This baby monitor has all the major features I was looking for, and they function reliably.PROS:- SECURE. This is a huge thing for me. I've heard horror stories about bad actors easily hacking vulnerable internet-connected cameras and the like. The fact that these communicate with local signals gives me peace of mind.- High quality image. I have the baby in a bassinet next to the bed, but even when I'm right there I look at the monitor to make sure the baby is ok because the picture quality is so good.- Sensitive enough microphones to pick up small noises from 5-10 ft away- Reliable signal. I have a medium sized 3 bedroom apt, and I've never seen the screen so much as blip no matter how far away I am, even with my wifi router in the middle of the house (which can cause signal interference)- Camera range of motion is excellent, almost complete 360- 2-way microphone works well- Cord length: the cords are LONG, at least 10 feet. Makes it very easy to maneuver with the cameras and monitor- Night vision is solid. No discernible drop in quality when night vision turns on. Also night vision comes on automatically when light is low enough- Interface is decent and controls are satisfactorily responsive- Split screen works flawlessly- Zoom is great. I think it's a digital zoom, but because the resolution is so high and the monitor is relatively small you don't notice any quality drop.CONS:- No intuitive/easy way to mount the cameras. Unless the camera has a high enough vantage point to see, but not so high that the camera can't pan down enough, you have to mount it somehow. They have slots for wall mounting, but I'm not aware of any easy hook-ups to a clip that can be mounted on the edge of a bassinet/crib.- The devices are made of a cheap-feeling plastic. This isn't something I care much about, especially because all the features are there and work as expected, but if you do care then it's worth knowing about.- There are a few other bells and whistles I don't care for, but if I did I don't think they're all that good. For example, the built-in songs or the temperature sensor (the sensor is inaccurate by a few degrees). I prefer things to do one thing and do it well. Obviously with something like a baby monitor there's a lot you want in it, but some of the stuff crosses the line in my opinion.All in all I am very happy with this monitor, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a similar feature set.",,Nursery
,"Hubble Connected Nursery Pal Connect Touch - 5"" HD Touch Screen Display and Wi-Fi Smart Video Baby Monitor, Remote Pan/Tilt/Zoom - Portable Wireless Camera – Interactive and Educational Content","I bought this for traveling and it is perfect for that. I don’t think I would like it for the nursery every day. The best feature is the camera can be bent to look downward which is very important for pack-n-plays, as you cannot see through the pack-n-play side panels on ANY camera at night. Camera has to look into pack-n-play from the top.Pros:Small and compact, easy to packBoth parts are super lightGreat priceVery good audioClear pictureCamera doesn’t make clicking noise when parent screen turns onCons:Small cords. Camera needs a longer cordScreen is super tiny, wouldn’t recommend for someone who wants to see if their baby is breathingZoom in sucksNo temperature monitoring!!Can’t move the camera around much from parent remoteNo time on parent remote so you have to look at your phone to know what time it is. Really annoying in the middle of the night!!Over 4/5 bc it is cheap and good quality enough for traveling or experienced moms. First time moms, get one with a way bigger screen and temperature checker!",,Nursery
,"Hubble Connected Nursery Pal Connect Touch - 5"" HD Touch Screen Display and Wi-Fi Smart Video Baby Monitor, Remote Pan/Tilt/Zoom - Portable Wireless Camera – Interactive and Educational Content","I have this setup in my baby's room and I was able to set this up on my own. I installed this on a wall that allows me to show not only the window in my baby's room but her whole room with her crib. The magnet that holds the camera has a sticky part on the other side of it. Once I cleaned the wall, I was able to mount it on the wall. The camera has a magnet inside of the base and still just stick to the metal disc immediately. The camera is really easy to adjust and connect to the monitor. The monitor is roughly the same size as my old iPhone or even my old iPod. It can either stand on it's own or be carried around. It's very similar to my security cameras but with this, I get a better 2 way with this. With my security cameras, there's a 2-3 second delay when using it's 2 way function. With this monitor, when I start talking, it's immediate as if I was using a 2 way radio. Whether I'm using this during the day or at night, the picture quality is absolutely amazing. Even when it shows at night, I can clearly see where my baby is and if my other one sneaks in to ""check"" on their sibling or wake them up. The remote options on the handheld monitor is really easy to use and since the camera rotates, it allows me to move this camera in any direction I want. Love how easy this was for me to setup and install on my own. Great picture quality and the sound is completely clear.",,Nursery
,"Hubble Connected Nursery Pal Connect Touch - 5"" HD Touch Screen Display and Wi-Fi Smart Video Baby Monitor, Remote Pan/Tilt/Zoom - Portable Wireless Camera – Interactive and Educational Content","We have an infant optics monitor and with baby #2 arriving soon I wanted something with a split screen. Having limited options in the market and available thru Amazon for our registry I decided to try this one.Video quality is amazing in both light and dark settings, switching from one camera to the other is a breeze and the menu is intuitive and easy to use.The biggest issue I saw in reviews is the audio/volume so I want to address that. Yes, it's different from what I came to expect of traditional monitors in the market. Here's why: we expect continuous sound to come out of the monitor and most of us use a sound machine in children's rooms.This monitor has different modes: audio only, video/audio on, entirely off, or the eco/vox mode.What they don't explain very well is that even with full audio and video, or audio only the monitor recognizes the white noise as such and doesn't transmit it loudly, but any sounds your baby makes (even knocking against the crib) come thru loud and clear, in all of the on modes.Do I wish it went a little louder? YES.Did it get some getting used to: YES.We have it now on the vox setting at a medium sensitivity. We sleep with white noise and so does my kid, well if he cries or whines at night, knocks against the crib or is chatting in the morning when he woke I still hear him perfectly and still wakes me up to alert me that he's up. All in all it does what it needs to do without adding noise pollution. I don't have to have my white noise higher to drown out his, they're not competing anymore and it's been lovely.Overall the volume for when he cries or needs attention is loud enough for us to hear it.I'll update my review if while we're testing it in more settings we notice other things. So far 4 stars out of 5. I'd do 4.5 if I could.",,Nursery

I went back and fourth with a wifi vs non wifi, but knowing this one does both gives me so much peace of mind! The app is very easy to navigate and I like that it records motion detected.Pros:- Wifi & non-wifi video capabilities. We have had no conection issues.- Super easy setup! Connected to the app right away.- Ability to move camera from the device- Pretty good picture & sound quality- The monitor is comes has a good quality screen and easy to navigate settings.Cons:- There are some cool features that the app can do, but with a subscription so thats not ideal- The camera needs to be mounted or put on a separate stand in order to get a good view of the crib. We bought a ""Baby Monitor Mount Camera Shelf Universal Baby Camera Holder"" which has been working out great! The view is still a little zoomed in but because the camera can be controlled remotely it is easy to move around to find baby's face.",,Nursery

I love that this can be used without wifi! I feel much safer given that it is safe from hackers. The range is pretty good as well.2. It can also be used with wifi with an app downloaded and it is useful since you can see your baby when you are outside while they are being babysat by somebody else. They also have a lot of different features like sound or motion detection.3. The app also has trackers for feeds, wet diapers, sleep, etc. that are easy to use.4. The picture and sound quality is great, i like the nightvision it is very clear.Cons:1. The parent unit does not hold a charge for longer than 2 hours, and even when the unit is on charge for the whole night it never shows full battery. Not sure if this is a defective unit or if this is in every parent unit. 2. There is also an ad that shows up everytime the parent unit is on and it takes a few seconds to load. It is pretty annoying to click out of it everytime.3.

,"Hubble Connected Nursery Pal Connect Touch - 5"" HD Touch Screen Display and Wi-Fi Smart Video Baby Monitor, Remote Pan/Tilt/Zoom - Portable Wireless Camera – Interactive and Educational Content","IBeen using it for almost a week and it serves it's purpose well.Pros:-For mounting it sticks directly to metal, or comes with a magnetic disk with a 3m backing, or 2 wall anchors. Camera can be angeled in many ways.-The remote camera light and all the other options which are controlled from the monitor worked easily.-Very far reach; our home is large, and placing the camera on one end of the house and the monitor on the other is about 300 feet. There was no issue with the transmission; the audio and video both came through clearly. Our house has many obstructions and WiFi is often difficult, so we were impressed with this ability.- There was no setup for me. I plugged in the camera, went across the house, plugged in the monitor, turned the monitor on, and I was connected. The instructions for connecting, in case you get disconnected, are straightforward.Cons:- The screen is small. The monitor itself is the size of a medium-sized cell phone, the screen is only about 1/2 of that, but the picture quality is acceptable.",,Nursery
,"Hubble Connected Nursery Pal Connect Touch - 5"" HD Touch Screen Display and Wi-Fi Smart Video Baby Monitor, Remote Pan/Tilt/Zoom - Portable Wireless Camera – Interactive and Educational Content","We actually are having a second child so instead of buying an additional camera for our existing babysense, we opted for a system with controllable cameras.The cameras and their picture quality are top notch. There's a light grain in night light but NOT MUCH. the cameras really are spectacular. The night light feature built into bases is also nice. It doesn't bother the night vision that I can tell.The best part about this system is the camera adjustability from the hand held. It's great. Every monitor system should have this feature.My only gripe is the microphone is super sensitive. It picks up our child breathing and sheets ruffling when he moves. I wish you could adjust the sensitivity of the mic. But that's honestly a minor complaint. I'm nitpicking at this point. For someone with a 6 month old you want that level of detail, but for a 2 year old, you're more confident they will sleep fine on their own.Bottom line, if you looking for a monitor system, this thing delivers. Comparing it to an older babysense system, as well as the Infant Optics dxr-8, it beats both hands down. I know, the dxr-8 is the bread and butter of monitors of late, but this thing has better picture quality, bigger screen, more range in camera motion, and it's a bit cheaper for a 2 camera system.",,Nursery

Previously had a summer infant camera/monitor, which wouldn’t keep a charge and was very frustrating - company did nothing to help when I reached out. Babysense product has great night vision (insanely clear/visible), battery life is really good and seems to have good range. I have 2 acres and didn’t lose connection in and around my home (about 50-60ft) but haven’t tested super far yet. I read in previous reviews that the sound isn’t the best but I see no issues with that. Lastly, their customer service has been amazing to deal with as there was an issue with my camera not pairing and they are now sending me a new one with no hesitation!

The Hubble Grip is especially helpful for hanging it wherever works best for you.Even with baby mode, options are prevalent. There are a collection of games, books, videos, and other content that my eldest son can use when I don’t need it. When you aren’t using the camera, you can choose to slide a privacy cover over the camera lens. All in all, this baby camera makes everything easier for this single parent.",,Nursery

,"Hubble Connected Nursery Pal Connect Touch - 5"" HD Touch Screen Display and Wi-Fi Smart Video Baby Monitor, Remote Pan/Tilt/Zoom - Portable Wireless Camera – Interactive and Educational Content","This baby monitor is like the Renaissance man of baby monitors. It does a lot of things! I haven't even explored all of its functionalities yet, but here are my favorite aspects so far:1. You can use it without wifi in your home. I really like this, because I'm nervous about hackers accessing the camera. We have a relatively small home, but the signal was fine when the camera was up in the nursery and we were downstairs.2. If you want, you can also download the app to your phone and access the camera via wifi. It's really useful to have both wifi-based and wifi-free options. The app can also push notifications on your phone when sounds or motion are detected.3. It's great to have a portable camera that can be temporarily mounted on a curtain rod or the top of a door using the flexible stand. I like being able to move the camera between the nursery and the living room depending on where the baby is.4. The app also has trackers for feeds, wet diapers, sleep, etc. that are easy to use.The music and audiobooks loaded for playing over the camera seem cute, though I haven't really used them since whenever I use the monitor the baby is sleeping. Some of these features, along with the pre-loaded games/videos on the parent unit would probably be more useful for older kids.Cons:1. There is an ad that shows up whenever the parent unit is powered on that you have to click out of. I expect ads with a free product, but not something that I've paid for, and I don't like that it delays me if I'm trying to see what's going on with my child.2. The charge on the parent unit doesn't seem to last very long, so I've just been keeping it plugged in most of the time when I use it.3. The video quality isn't that great, although it's definitely sufficient to monitor the baby.All in all, it's a baby monitor that does what it needs to do with a lot of added bonuses!",,Nursery

After using for a couple weeks, here are my pros and cons:Pros:- The unit feels sturdy, the rubberized case is nice, and I think the ring stand feature is pretty clever (it was really hard to open the first couple times but I think it just needed some breaking in).- Video quality is great in daylight.- Having the option to use either the standalone monitor or the app via wifi is really nice, depending on what I am doing. The motion detection feature and notification on the app could be really useful especially for an older kid.- The portability of the camera (being able to use while not plugged in) is very nice. I haven't tested how long the battery on it lasts though.- I like the option to play songs and stories through the monitor, as well as videos with the Hubble Connected features. I could see that being useful as my kid gets older, although not sure how often I would use it.- Privacy mode is a nice feature to ensure that the camera is really not broadcasting when you don't want it to be. Love that it has a temperature monitor.- I didn't personally use the baby tracking features on the app, but I can see how it would be nice to have that in one spot with your monitor viewer.- The flexi mount is a pretty clever design.Cons:- The night vision video quality is a little lacking in my opinion, compared to my Eufy monitor.- The touchscreen is lacking sensitivity a bit. It's a little difficult to scroll through settings and to pan the camera without going too far. At times it feels like the touch screen buttons are slow to respond to touch. Overall I prefer the physical buttons for panning and navigation on my Eufy monitor.- Adjusting settings on the monitor can be a little difficult with the touch screen, and it almost seems like some things are missing. I wish the display showed the time, for instance.- Low battery life on the monitor unit.",,Nursery
