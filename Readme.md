## Topic: Utilizing Topic Modelling in Customer Product Review for Classifying Baby Product

We are doing research on how wrong product reviews can cost the company time and budget, and also provide a solution by building a model consisting of topic modeling and 

text classification which will validate or alert when the wrong review is inputted.

We implemented:
+ Topic Modelling using LDA
+ Machine learning using various algorithm such as Logistic regression, SVM, etc. 

The developed model is the result of LDA and traditional machine learning model.
