I am a mum who is very into my organic products and unllike many others I have looked at, The Tutti Bimbi Freezer Tray is also BPA and phthalates free. The bright packaging and the ability to choose my colour attracted me to the listing and the fact that I can prepare 9 meals with a very generous portion size for my baby at one time is a massive advantage to me as a working mum. I can freeze the tray easily as it comes with a very easy clip on lid that also protects from freezer burn. I have found I can also put the baby food tray in the dishwasher fine. I would strongly recommend the Tutti Bimbi Baby Food Freezer Tray to any parent like myself who is looking for an easy way to make baby weaning food at home.',\n",
